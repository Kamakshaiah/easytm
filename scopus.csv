A total of 512 original samples were collected through purposive sampling methods and analyzed through structural equation modelling. The results reveal that credibility, trustworthiness, source credibility, and self-efficacy significantly impact brand trust, and trustworthiness, credibility; While self-efficacy played a significant role in the social media news to build strong brand trust. The brand trust had a positive and a robust mediating effect on consumer buying intention; and Persuasion knowledge positively moderates’ credibility, trustworthiness, source credibility, self-efficacy and consumer buying intention. This study provides important implications from marketing perceptive as it applies and extends the gratification theory and persuasion knowledge. Our findings are beneficial for key stakeholders of a brand that are facing serious advertising concerns due to widespread fake news. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Any malicious activities performed on a centralized server system or vehicle or riders destroy the fairness of the ride and cause the party discomfort. The drivers are assessed by the riders after the ride has been completed. There can be a malicious driver who can claim reimbursement with a fake complaint and give the driver a poor rating. The current system cannot determine the correctness of both parties' objections and delivers the biased outcome of each objection in accordance with the centralized marketing strategies of the company. In order to ensure fair travel, a workaround that can be blocked is presented. The creation, completion, unrest, or abortion of a ride will be published in the block chain booklet so that the peer-to-peer network is available to all participants.

Instagram is also an online playground of deceit. The use of filters, lighting, and cunning angles transforms the mundane into something spectacular. Automated spam accounts and fake profiles use this to their malicious advantage for executing attacks targeting high-profile executives. Creating fake Instagram identities is easy to reproduce the idea of being accepted by many fans on social media. Fake accounts are used in the marketing of fake services and products. This research focused on designing and training a unique neural network model and proposed a new algorithm for detecting automated spam and fake Instagram account profiles. The precision and accuracy of the proposed method were achieved at 93% and 91%, respectively. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Usually, the more popular influencers are paid more for their collaborations. Thus, many services were created to boost profiles' popularity metrics through bots or fake accounts. However, real people recently started participating in such boosting activities using their real accounts for monetary rewards, generating ungenuine content that is extremely difficult to detect. To date, no works have attempted to detect this new phenomenon, known as crowdturfing (CT), on Instagram. In this work, we propose the first Instagram CT engagement detector. Our algorithm leverages profiles' characteristics through semi-supervised learning to spot accounts involved in CT activities. Compared to the supervised approaches used so far to identify fake accounts, semi-supervised models can exploit huge quantities of unlabeled data to increase performance. We purchased and studied 1293 CT profiles from 11 providers to build our self-training classifier, which reached 95% F1-score. We tested our model in the wild by detecting and analyzing CT engagement from 20 mega-influencers (i.e., with more than one million followers), and discovered that more than 20 % was artificial. We analyzed the CT profiles and comments, showing that it is difficult to detect these activities based solely on their generated content. © 2023 IEEE."

This study aimed to augment the understanding of VI marketing by exploring the relationship between VI’s characteristics (i.e., their humanlikeness level and operator type), their social media post characteristics (i.e., emotional expression, use of pronouns, use of punctuation marks), and consumer engagement. The analysis of three popular VIs’ Instagram profiles and posts revealed that VIs with less humanlike appearances tend to exhibit stronger positive emotional expressions. Interestingly, the level of humanlikeness in appearance was not associated with VI's other post characteristics, suggesting other intrinsic factors (e.g., the VI’s character and virtual universe) may play a pivotal role. Whether a brand operates the VI or not made a statistically significant difference in the VI’s post characteristics. Assessment of user engagement metrics (i.e., number of likes and comments) showed that users prefer hyper-realistic VIs and VIs operated by non-brand agencies, underscoring the importance of perceived authenticity in the digital realm. The emotions expressed by VIs, along with their use of punctuation, were positively related to user engagement. © The Author(s) 2024."

In this study, a systematic literature review protocol was followed, in which 28 influencer marketing studies from January 2012 to January 2022 from ten databases were selected, and relevant data were extracted to answer the research questions. There are 11 identified threats to influencer marketing and include the following: fake followers and fake comments; lack of proper disclosure and explanation of sponsorship; inappropriate influencer selection; heavy brand control over influencers; insufficient brand control over content produced by influencers before publishing; choosing an inappropriate platform; the negative influence of influencers on the appearance of the brand; negative influence on the consumption, habits, and lifestyle of children; lack of proper and special contracts with influencers; increased saturation rate; and running parallel advertising for brands. The most prominent threats identified in the studies include inappropriate influencer selection; choosing an inappropriate platform; and the negative influence of influencers on the appearance of the brand. Using an inductive approach and zooming in and out of the target research, a general framework for influencer marketing threats was obtained.

Amplified by the speed and scope of social media, they can quickly reach millions of people and result in a wide range of marketplace deceptions. However, extant understandings of deepfakes’ implications in the marketplace are limited and fragmented. Against this background, we develop insights into the significance of deepfakes for firms and consumers—the threats they pose, how to mitigate those threats, and the opportunities they present. Our findings indicate that the main risks to firms include damage to image, reputation, and trustworthiness and the rapid obsolescence of existing technologies. However, consumers may also suffer blackmail, bullying, defamation, harassment, identity theft, intimidation, and revenge porn. We then accumulate and present knowledge on the strategies and mechanisms to safeguard against deepfake-based marketplace deception. Furthermore, we uncover and report the various legitimate opportunities offered by this new technology. Finally, we present an agenda for future research in this emergent and highly critical area. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."

However, the current business model of social media is often seen as in conflict with users' digital wellbeing. In 2020, a study investigated users' willingness to pay monetary fees for social media digital wellbeing services. In the present work, we replicated this study in Q4 of 2022, aiming to explore any changes in interest and willingness to pay for these services. In addition, we extended the replication by conducting qualitative analysis on participants' comments to gain deeper insight and identify reasons for payment and reasons for rejecting to pay. Data were collected from 262 participants through an online questionnaire. The survey focused on four services: better data protection, less use of data for marketing, aiding users in controlling their prolonged usage, and reducing fake news and radicalisation on social media. The results showed that the willingness to pay for these services was significantly higher in 2022 compared to the results published in 2020. Participants expressed concerns about the feasibility and fairness of the alternative business model, which requires users to pay for safety and support. Our findings suggest a growing interest in digital wellbeing services, emphasizing the need for social media platforms to assess the feasibility of alternative business models, identify user segments, and take measures to enhance consumers’ trust, accordingly. © 2024"

Design/methodology/approach: Under a qualitative and inductive paradigm, the research was based on the search for news on the Google pages. Data were grouped into higher categories to formalize theoretical generalizations. Findings: Data analysis showed that there are news classified into 11 codes, forming three news groups broadcast as an effort by the programs to legitimize themselves with society: Perceived Quality, Publicity Produced and Results Achieved. Research limitations/implications: The relationship between the effectiveness of public policies and their dissemination in digital media has implications for the result/legitimacy relationship, not excluding that public marketing can make a program legitimate without having results that confirm its effectiveness. Social implications: The work provides a means of understanding the dissemination of public policies, in particular, verifying whether these are being provided in order to establish responsible and transparent communication with the citizen or to legitimize public policies without effective results. Originality/value: The proposed conceptual model is based on four quadrants and represents the relationship between the results achieved by public policies and legitimacy, considering a phenomenon resulting from public marketing. The association between the intensity of these constructs constitutes four themes: fake public marketing, inefficient public policy, deficient public marketing and full public policy. © 2021, Fernanda Rodrigues de Siqueira, Carlos André da Silva Müller and Osmar Siena."

The chapter utilized qualitative case study approach through interviews and participant observation. Using purposive sampling, a sample of ten respondents were interviewed in Kano and Kaduna. The author found that social media has strategic positive implications for the marketing of Islamic medicines in Northern Nigeria. In addition, Islamic medicine practitioners use content creation and influencer marketing to create awareness and increase visibility of their products. The prospects of social media adoption lie in the promotion and customization of advertising strategies such as influencer marketing and content creation, which draw attention and aid in promoting a product. Despite its prospect in expanding market share, lack of regulation and the spread of fake news pose serious challenges. Therefore, the chapter suggested that the Nigerian government should support and encourage the business of Islamic medicine through regulations on health standards, fair marketing policies and sound digital innovation. © 2023, IGI Global.

The platform now provides personalized user recommendations and direct marketing due to AI and big data developments. As a result, it's essential to understand the primary issues people have while using Instagram for shopping. 128 Instashoppers were surveyed in order to gain further insight into these concerns. The results showed that users' top concerns are the security of their personal and financial information and the presence of fake sellers. Yet the study also discovered that some elements, including a legitimate UAE trade license, positive word-of-mouth recommendations, and a well-designed page layout, can make buyers feel more comfortable when shopping with Instagram sellers.

There are various examples of how social networks can affect the behavior of individuals, like viral marketing, the spread of memes, and the propagation of fake news. This dynamic of information diffusion has motivated the research of several approaches to identify the prominent influencers in a network. The Influence Maximization Problem consists of identifying a subset S, called a seed set, of at most k elements to achieve the maximum (expected) propagation through a diffusion model, with S as the initial influencers on a network. It demonstrated that the influence maximization problem is an NP-hard optimization problem. Therefore, it is unfeasible to identify the subset S that ensures the most extensive diffusion due to its complexity. The most typical approach to this problem is using approximate algorithms, highlighting the Cost-Effective Lazy Forward (CELF), about 700 times faster than the greedy strategy proposed by Kemp et al., and CELF++, which presents a runtime gain of between 35 to 55% over CELF. This work modifies the two above-mentioned state-of-the-art algorithms, CELF and CELF++, replacing Monte Carlo simulations with functions to calculate the diffusion estimations (metamodels) for selecting a set of seeds. The adoption of well-known methods in the literature with metamodels can identify orders of magnitude faster, more influential individuals and, in some cases, even outperform the results of these methods in terms of propagation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

It also gauges the ideological standpoint of youth in Pakistan that influences their voting decisions. An online campaign has become an indispensable source for politicians to influence the masses without the constraints of distance and time. It is a quantitative study based on a questionnaire survey of young Pakistani voters. Findings show that Facebook has presumed the role of an instigator in shaping the voting behavior of educated youth. Respondents perceived Facebook as biased while expressing views and assisted political entities in manipulating the data to increase their vote bank. Though the majority of them haven’t experienced fake news so either they are not conscious or they trust blindly the information. Furthermore, respondents’ cognitive abilities are not obstructed by politicians using Facebook, instead, friends and family network seems more persuasive in determining voters’ choice. Results manifest that ideological standpoint impacts voters’ decisions substantially. There is no statistical difference in the voting behavior of respondents based on gender and/or age. The individuality of this study is that it focuses on the medium of communication between politicians and youth instead of emphasizing the social cleavages and their impact on voters’ decisions, which Pakistani scholars largely study. This study will prompt the field of psephology in Pakistan, which is largely ignored, and help scholars to move out of the domain of identity politics. © The Author(s) 2024."

The purpose of internationalization is to make sure that like the universities from Europe, the US, Australia and other white-centric geopolitical locations of the world, the universities in India can attain global distinctions in terms of rankings, publications, curriculums and pedagogies. However, the execution process is plagued with flawed, superficial and grossly researched policies. To explain further, the initiatives for internationalizing the higher education systems are being undertaken at a rapid pace and in uncritical ways. For example, the focus of internationalization is centered on private universities, with not much focus on government-run institutions. In the name of student and faculty exchange programs, the universities in India are being flooded with white academicians whose physical visibility matters more than scholarliness. Their visibility on the university campuses is regarded as a potential marketing tool to initiate various forms of degree programs and motivate students to pay enormous amounts of registration fees. This opinion piece discusses how the project of internationalization of universities in India is engulfed with the phenomena of cargo cultism and whiteness syndrome. The arguments have been supported with personal conversations with two research participants from two private universities that are based in Noida and Hyderabad. Besides personal conversations, the arguments have also been supported by informal conversations with friends and colleagues and by analyzing photos, videos, and writings that are posted on social media by the university as markers of appreciation and success. © 2024.

It makes the observed data contain a large number of fake negatives that temporarily have no feedback but will convert later. Training on such biased data distribution would severely harm the performance of models. Prevailing approaches wait for a set period of time to see if samples convert before training on them, but solutions to guaranteeing data freshness remain under-explored by current research. In this work, we propose Delayed Feedback modeling via neural Satellite Networks (DFSN for short) for online CVR prediction. It tackles the issue of data freshness to permit adaptive waiting windows. We first assign a long waiting window for our main model to cover most of conversions and greatly reduce fake negatives. Meanwhile, two kinds of satellite models are devised to learn from the latest data, and online transfer learning techniques are utilized to sufficiently exploit their knowledge. With information from satellites, our main model can deal with the issue of data freshness, achieving better performance than previous methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world advertising datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

The purpose of this study is to understand how social media fake news effects firm performance, and how to mitigate such effects. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded on dynamic capability view (DCV), this study suggests that social media fake news effects firm performance via SC disruption (SCD) and SC resilience (SCR). Moreover, the relation between SCD and SCR is contingent upon SC learning (SCL) – a moderated mediation effect. To validate this complex model, the authors suggest effectiveness of using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Using an online survey, the results support the authors’ hypotheses. Findings: The results suggest that social media fake news does not affect firm performance directly. However, the authors’ serial mediation test confirms that SCD and SCR sequentially mediate the relationship between social media fake news and firm performance. In addition, a moderated serial mediation test confirms that a higher level of SCL strengthens the SCD–SCR relationship. Research limitations/implications: This work offers a new theoretical and managerial perspective to understand the effect of fake news on firm performance, in the context of crises, e.g. COVID-19. In addition, this study offers the advancement of PLS as more robust for real-world applications and more advantageous when models are complex. Originality/value: Prior studies in the SC and marketing domain suggest different effects of social media fake news on consumer behavior (e.g. panic buying) and SCD, respectively.

During the Post-COVID-19 pandemic, a rapid increase in digital media and E-commerce usage was observed in all parts of the world for personal and professional aspects. The increase in misinformation through these platforms is a major challenge that the current governments face today as rumors and fake news creates severe detrimental implications in society. In this work, we consider fake reviews and misinformation in online digital networks as a single disease, and thereby, by considering the recent trends in online social media marketing, we formulate a pandemic model for digital networks with a psychological state of human choice. The positivity and stability of the model are mathematically tested and validated. Our analysis and simulation prove that the system is stable and justifiable in the real-world digital environment.

This has promoted the reemergence of a more personal transaction model on the dark web: single vendor shops. To date, little is known about how single vendors display trust to attract potential customers without relying on the structural trust provided by cryptomarkets’ review and escrow systems. A total of 108 single vendor shops were identified. A coding grid was used to determine whether vendors displayed any of the four categories of trust signals typically found on cryptomarkets (i.e., signals related to identity, marketing, security, and signals that directly express trust). While the majority of single vendor shops were involved in illicit drug dealing, other products such as electronics, weapons, and fake documents were also offered. On average, shops displayed few trust signals. However, variations between different kinds of vendors were found: while vendors involved in illicit drug dealing displayed more identity- and marketing-related trust signals, vendors involved in fraud displayed more security-related signals and signals that directly expressed trust. Differences between vendors might be due to the nature of the products they offer and to the level of competition in their respective markets. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

The study's research question is: How do fake reviews in news media and the recency of non-existent hospitality establishment reviews influence the behavioural intentions of the viewer? The findings of a qualitative study on the place of interest, namely, a (non-existent) restaurant with fake reviews in news stories, were used as a background analysis. A purposive sampling technique and thematic analysis approach were adopted. Dark branding is conceptualised as a form of branding involving questionable ethical practices such as fake online reviews and forms a basis for consumer activism within the dark marketing spectrum. The approach of using emotional marketing, for example, selling mood/comfort instead of tangible products such as food, the novelty of service delivery, servicescape, and signature storytelling, are attributes of dark branding.

Safeguarding online presence is paramount for any business, emphasizing the crucial role of social media security. Protection measures encompass thwarting targeted phishing attacks, fortifying corporate accounts against hacking, and preventing social engineering scams. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter offer opportunities for fraudsters to exploit, employing legitimate but fake accounts to gain trust and extract sensitive information. Scammers adeptly craft fraudulent accounts, mimicking individuals or companies, spreading malware, online attacks, and misinformation to deceive followers and company employees into revealing private data or corporate secrets. To enhance security, an envisioned end-to-end app proposes registering mobile numbers with a password consisting of zigzag images or by sliding computer-generated images to create a unique pattern. This complements the existing module facilitating easier SIM card identification. Decentralized blockchain formed by users in communication, as opposed to a private blockchain with a central authority, is proposed. Our social media platform prioritizes two-factor authentication, requiring users to log in with their email and password, and then verifying the login request with a unique one-time password sent to their phone number during the initiation of the login request. © 2024, Ismail Saritas.

How to effectively predict cascade growth size has become a significant problem. Most previous methods based on deep learning have achieved remarkable results, while concentrating on mining structural and temporal features from diffusion networks and propagation paths. Whereas, the ignorance of spread dynamic information restricts the improvement of prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Physics-informed graph convolutional network (PiGCN) for cascade prediction, which combines explicit features (structural and temporal features) and propagation dynamic status in learning diffusion ability of cascades. Specifically, PiGCN is an end-to-end predictor, firstly splitting a given cascade into sub-cascade graph sequence and learning local structures of each sub-cascade via graph convolutional network , then adopting multi-layer perceptron to predict the cascade growth size. Moreover, our dynamic neural network, combining PDE-like equations and a deep learning method, is designed to extract potential dynamics of cascade diffusion, which captures dynamic evolution rate both on structural and temporal changes. To evaluate the performance of our proposed PiGCN model, we have conducted extensive experiment on two well-known large-scale datasets from Sina Weibo and ArXIv subject listing HEP-PH to verify the effectiveness of our model. The results of our proposed model outperform the mainstream model, and show that dynamic features have great significance for cascade size prediction. © 2024 The Author(s).

As one of the social networks, Instagram has a global scope and an essential role in the field of interpersonal communication in various personal and professional dimensions. One of the significant problems in this platform is the existence of fake accounts with incorrect statistics. In this research, by analyzing the pages of Instagram users, the association between the metrics used to measure the performance of these pages has been investigated. For this purpose, the data of 1860 public pages on Instagram were collected as metrics of the number of followers, comments, likes, posts, followers, and the post's topic. The hypotheses test results show a statistically significant correlation between the number of posts and likes. However, there is no statistically significant association between the number of likes and comments, the number of followers and comments, and the number of followers and likes. The analysis of 100 verified Instagram pages shows that the proposed method can distinguish real from fake pages with 94% accuracy and should be considered in business marketing ads on Instagram.

Complex algorithms are designed to present information effectively based on user intent. The online experience of users is a combination of various behaviors exhibited to seek information, including searching, sharing, and verifying information. However, this multifaceted user behavior is yet to be explored comprehensively. This research contributes towards proposing a user intent-machine learning model for classifying users based on their online search, share, and verification behavior, identifying different types of users based on their online engagement, and demonstrating that dynamic online interactions can be classified based on their searching, sharing, and verifying behavior. User feedback on online behavior and practices is gathered through a questionnaire, encompassing participants from diverse gender, occupational, and age demographics. Following the extensive feature engineering, the significant features are presented to K-Mean clustering to identify user intent classes or profiles and their characteristics. A supervised learning Linear Discriminant Analysis Classifier (LDAC) is then trained on data to classify these classes. The proposed framework successfully predicted the user intent class with 80% accuracy. The model is further tested on users' dynamic interaction data gathered through a second user study. The information search, share, and verify activity data is transformed to fit the model and labeled by human raters using the user profiles resulting from clustering. The research achieves an Inter-rater reliability (IRR) of 60%, whereas the model predicted the user with 67% accuracy. This research indicates that a user's purpose in seeking information, their willingness to share information on social media, and their inclination to view information as credible can all contribute to understanding their intentions, identifying behavioral similarities, and can be used to recognize intent through dynamic interactions that can be used in targeted marketing, and search engine optimization.  © 2013 IEEE."

Hence, with these promising features comes the threat of misinformation propagation, leading to undesirable effects. Therefore, accurate verification of fraudulent content on time is in high demand. Hence, to tackle this problem, we proposed a novel framework WSCH-CNN (web scrapping content heading CNN) model which counters the issue of fake (or mislead) news using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The framework consists of two CNN models named content model and heading model, which are used to find the linguistic similarities in fake news, and classifies them into real news or fake news. Both the models are evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely Kaggle dataset and fake news challenge dataset, and two self-compiled real-world datasets, namely text dataset (text dataset of news articles) and multimedia dataset (Image dataset compiled from Facebook and Twitter), using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as evaluation metrics. Moreover, the recognition accuracy achieved on these datasets is compared with similar state-of-the-art results. The proposed WSCH-CNN model proved quite successful in detecting the fake news with a high accuracy of 85.06% on multimedia dataset, 94.16% for heading model and 85.32% for content model which supersedes the state-of-the-art. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature."

Design/methodology/approach: Using the survey method, this study recruited 331 textile SME entrepreneurs and validated the proposed model and hypotheses in AMOS. Findings: The outcomes reveal that information sharing, information quality and technological innovation are positively related to firm performance, while technological innovation mediates the association between the information processing paradigm (i.e. information sharing and information quality) and firm performance. Practical implications: The findings enable the firms to bring technological innovation and realize the best performance by seeking and sharing valuable information across the firm. The managers should ensure a culture of quality information sharing, improve coordination among departments and discourage irrelevant/fake information. Such practices are beneficial for firm decision-makers when formulating business plans and focusing on communication mechanisms that will assist them in attaining higher innovation levels and firm performance.

Greenwashing degrades essential efforts to reduce climate change and pollution and to promote social justice. False marketing communication that claims products are sustainable hurts the value of green products and weakens customer capability to prefer sustainable to nonsustainable products. Greenwashing also eliminates trust in “green” products. Markets infected by fake “green” products ultimately fail to provide the necessary sustainable transformation. Our study demonstrates that consumer access to reliable transparent, traceable, and tamperproof product information counteracts perceived greenwashing among consumers of ecological foods. Furthermore, our data indicate that blockchain information significantly more than certification systems safeguard consumers against the threat of greenwashing. Information validating authenticity promotes the development of sustainable products, protects intellectual property rights for suppliers of green products, and safeguards the supply of green products to consumers.

Researchers have attempted to propose various models by combining different sources of information, including text, social relation, and contextual data, which indeed has achieved promising results. However, existing approaches still suffer from certain constraints, such as: 1) a very few samples are available and 2) prediction models are not easy to be generalized for users from new regions - which are challenges that motivate our study. In this article, we propose a general framework for identifying user geolocation - MetaGeo, which is a meta-learning-based approach, learning the prior distribution of the geolocation task in order to quickly adapt the prediction toward users from new locations. Different from typical meta-learning settings that only learn a new concept from few-shot samples, MetaGeo improves the geolocation prediction with conventional settings by ensembling numerous mini-tasks. In addition, MetaGeo incorporates probabilistic inference to alleviate two issues inherent in training with few samples: location uncertainty and task ambiguity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaGeo, we conduct extensive experimental evaluations on three real-world datasets and compare the performance with several state-of-the-art benchmark models.

The availability of vaccines does not always mean utilization. This is because, people have less confidence in vaccines, which resulted in vaccination hesitancy and developing global decline in vaccine intake and has caused viral disease outbreaks worldwide. Therefore, there is a need to understand people’s perceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine to help the manufacturing companies of the vaccine to improve their marketing strategy based on the rejection causes. In this paper, we used multi-class Sentiment Analysis to classify people’s opinions from extracted tweets about COVID-19 vaccines, using firstly different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and secondly various Deep Learning (DL) models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), RNN-LSTM and RNN-GRU. Then, we investigated the analysis of the negative tweets to identify the causes of rejection using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Finally, we classified these negative tweets according to the rejection causes for all the vaccines using the same selected ML and DL models. The result of SA showed that DT gives the best performance with an accuracy of 92.26% and for DL models, GRU achieved 96.83%. Then, we identified five causes: Lack of safety, Side effect, Production problem, Fake news and Misinformation, and Cost.

However, it is not uncommon to see companies masterminding deceptive eWOM, disguising promotional messages as user-generated product reviews to attract and retain consumers. The extant literature is extremely limited regarding deceptive eWOM and its long-term effects. Ours is the first longitudinal study to examine consumers’ belief and attitude changes in the context of deceptive eWOM. This study found that, in a herding situation, deceptive eWOM can strongly influence changes in consumers’ beliefs and attitudes, whether in the early phase or mainstream phase, at the pre-adoption stage. If deceptive eWOM emerges earlier, it has a more powerful influence later. At the post-adoption stage, once they have used it, consumers may change their evaluations of a new product. However, this new evaluation is still subject to the initial anchoring effect brought by deceptive eWOM. If consumers sense deceptive eWOM and attribute it to a certain responsible party, the anchoring effect will be weakened. These findings provide further knowledge and understanding of the effects of deceptive eWOM, with implications for firms seeking to develop more effective eWOM marketing strategies. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

This study aims to critically examine the associated benefits and challenges of online shopping from the perspective of customers in the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of the relevant literature published between 2020 and 2022 was conducted via performing comprehensive search query in leading scholarly databases “Scopus and Web of Science” with the restriction of their predefined subject category of “Business.” Overall, 30 research studies were selected for the review and a significant number of studies were published in 2021 (n = 15). Findings: The research findings revealed that customers are motivated to shop online because of perceived benefits such as time-saving, convenience, 24/7 accessibility, interactive services without physical boundaries, trust, website attractiveness and cost-saving. However, challenging factors such as financial scams, privacy concerns, poor quality of products and services, fake promotions and reduced social interaction have hindered the growth of online shopping. The recommendations regarding designing marketing strategies, secured transaction, multiple payment options, trust building, protection of privacy, promotion via social media, effective mechanism to secure and timely delivery of product are helpful to improve the service quality of online shopping. Originality/value: The outcomes of this research are valuable to online retailers and policymakers, as it highlights how the benefits can enhance customers’ shopping intentions and minimize the impact of associated challenges. This study also recommends the redesigning of user-friendly interfaces of online shopping websites and ensures their privacy, security and performance on a regular basis. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Online social networks are arguably the main vehicle of fake news spread. Educating online users with explanations is one way of preventing this spread. Understanding how online belief is formed and changed may offer a roadmap for such education. The literature includes surveys addressing online opinion formation and polarization; however, they usually address a single domain, such as politics, online marketing, health, and education, and do not make online belief change their primary focus. Unlike other studies, this work is the first to present a cross-domain systematic literature review of user studies, methodologies, and opinion model dimensions. It also includes the orthogonal polarization dimension, focusing on online belief change. We include peer-reviewed works published in 2020 and later found in four relevant scientific databases, excluding theoretical publications that did not offer validation through dataset experimentation or simulation. Bibliometric networks were constructed for better visualization, leading to the organization of the papers that passed the review criteria into a comprehensive taxonomy. Our findings show that a person's individuality is the most significant influential force in online belief change. We show that online arguments that balance facts with emotionally evoking content are more efficient in changing their beliefs. Polarization was shown to be cross-correlated among multiple subjects, with politics being the central polarization pole. Polarized online networks start as networks with high opinion segregation, evolve into subnetworks of consensus, and achieve polarization around social network influencers. Trust in the information source was demonstrated to be the chief psychological construct that drives online users to polarization. This shows that changing the beliefs of influencers may create a positive snowball effect in changing the beliefs of polarized online social network users. These findings lay the groundwork for further research on using personalized explanations to reduce the harmful effects of online fake news on social networks.  © 2024 Filipe Altoe et al."

Related to the book market of interbellum Romania, Minar was frequently branded as the “man-of-the-day” while his publications followed the logic of the “hand-in-glove” ephemerides Notwithstanding the challenges of the term “bestseller,” we turned to it so as to better describe Minar’s cultural products as multiple-layered offers, catering for both low-brow and high-brow readership and seizing signals from both public’s expectations (myth-making, melodrama, sensation, narrative simplicity) and enormous patrimonial gaps (editing the classics, writing the recent authors’ biographies). After a careful examination of Minar’s works, we reached the conclusion that he was an exceptional entrepreneur of letters and, nonetheless, a literary historian endowed with a “melodramatic imagination” as well as with a playwright’s and a genre novelist’s plume. A swift intuition of marketing basics helped him realize, quite rapidly, that historical facts and documents could be merchandized: this is how his impressive collection of Romanian writers’ miscellanea was wrapped as a commodity for the public. If the juridical and moral aspects of his literary ventures were put in between brackets, we would discover an astonishing and ingenious personality who glided between different speech registers, and popularized literary history as a genre belonging to the big tent of mass culture. We should thus take into consideration that the logic of the paraliterary circuit can also be applied to literary history. Boiled down to essentials, counting on citations and on minimal critical comments, spiced with images (facsimile and pictures), Minar’s literary histories had their share in speeding the process of cultural literacy of average Romanian readers and in institutionalizing literary ideas. © 2023 Komitet Slowianoznawstwa PAN.

Yet, with the growth of social media, it has become a lucrative business for Web publishers. Despite many studies performed and countermeasures proposed, unreliable news sites have increased in the last years their share of engagement among the top performing news sources. Stifling fake news impact depends on our efforts in limiting the (economic) incentives of fake news producers. In this paper, we aim at enhancing the transparency around these exact incentives, and explore: Who supports the existence of fake news websites via paid ads, either as an advertiser or an ad seller? Who owns these websites and what other Web business are they into? We are the first to systematize the auditing process of fake news revenue flows. We identify the companies that advertise in fake news websites and the intermediary companies responsible for facilitating those ad revenues. We study more than 2,400 popular news websites and show that well-known ad networks, such as Google and IndexExchange, have a direct advertising relation with more than 40% of fake news websites. Using a graph clustering approach on 114.5K sites, we show that entities who own fake news sites, also operate other types of websites pointing to the fact that owning a fake news website is part of a broader business operation. © 2023 Owner/Author."

Currently, social networks are commonly used for sharing thoughts, feelings, information, and personal life, which vary from individual to individual. The world has witnessed a tremendous increase in social media usage in the last decade, and more people are expected to spend their time online after the COVID-19 pandemic. This increases the rapid propagation of rumors and fake news within societies and communities. On one end, social networks act as an excellent platform for digital marketing and sharing information. However, on the other end, social network rumors and fake news create a significant impact on society, including riots. To study and analyze social network rumors, several mathematical rumor propagation epidemic models have been proposed. The majority are related to disease-spreading epidemic models and reject the human aspect of social selection. This paper introduces a new mathematical rumor propagation model for social networks by incorporating the human psychological aspect of selection as a separate state. Our mathematical analysis and computational simulation proved that the model exists within the system. It was also proven that the system is always non-negative and there always exists a solution in the system. Our implementation of an intervention mechanism within the discrete compartmental model simulation proved the necessity of an effective interference that can help to prevent the implications of uncontrolled rumor dissemination within social networks. © 2022 by the authors."

The case of Rick’s Café, known worldwide for the movie Casablanca, situates that question. Rick’s was a set constructed on a Hollywood sound stage. Another Rick’s was created materially in Casablanca decades later. Consumers are aware of this liminal condition. It is the reflexivity inherent in this awareness of performative inauthenticity that makes the case both appropriate and nuanced as an opportunity to explore paradoxes of authenticity embodied in a tourist place. The authenticity-fakery relationship is considered theoretically, not as a dualism (either-or), but as a duality (both-and). Empirically, the case is analyzed through an onsite investigation and a virtual ethnography. Four paradoxical dimensions of authenticity (liminal environment, liminal interpretation, liminal affectivity, and liminal recreation) are identified. Tourists, we submit, may experience several authenticities (i.e., objective, constructed, and existential) simultaneously and paradoxically, contributing to a reconceptualization of the tourist experience. © The Author(s) 2024."

The aims of this study were to investigate how and which non-prescribed benzodiazepines are being sourced; forms, appearance and packaging; and awareness of risks associated with non-prescribed benzodiazepines. Methods: Data were collected from a sample of Australians who inject drugs or use ecstasy and/or other illicit stimulants on a monthly or more frequent basis, and who reported past 6-month use of non-prescribed benzodiazepines (n = 235 and n = 250, respectively). Data were collected on source, diversion from a known/trusted prescription, product name and aesthetic characteristics for the last non-prescribed benzodiazepine obtained. Results: Amongst participants who injected drugs, 71% reported that their last non-prescribed benzodiazepines were diverted from a known/trusted prescription, compared to 59% of participants who used ecstasy/other stimulants. Sourcing via cryptomarkets was rare. Across both samples, the majority reported last obtaining substances sold/marketed as diazepam or alprazolam. Participants sourcing via non-diverted means were twice as likely to obtain alprazolam. Known sourcing of novel compounds was rare. Amongst participants who used ecstasy/other stimulants, 36% reported confidence in the content/dose of non-prescribed benzodiazepines even when the source is unknown. Discussion and Conclusions: Most participants obtained substances sold as classic/registered benzodiazepines, mostly via diverted prescriptions, with a substantial minority potentially unaware of counterfeits circulating. While diverted use undeniably presents risks, tightening of prescriptions in Australia could inadvertently lead to greater supply of novel benzodiazepines as seen internationally, reinforcing prioritisation of demand and harm reduction strategies. © 2023 The Authors.

However, some retailers have started to match an order by using a customer's name. Six studies, including an incentive-compatible experiment and field study, examine whether, when, and why order identification by a customer's name can either benefit or harm retailers. In contrast to prior research suggesting a negative effect of using a customer's name in marketing communications (e.g., online ads), the current research demonstrates a positive effect of identifying an order by name, which we refer to as the “Starbucks effect.” This positive effect, however, is mitigated or even backfires under specific circumstances. The results suggest that managers can use customers’ names while avoiding the use of numbers to increase customer preference for stores and service satisfaction, but with caution, especially in situations where privacy concerns may arise, even when the customer is only asked for their first name and could provide a fake name. © 2024"

Despite efforts to protect supply chains in the European Union (EU), authorities continue to find falsified medicine. We studied how in Romania, one of the poorest EU countries, political and economic factors influence the risk of patients being exposed to falsified medicines. Methods For this case study, we reviewed 131 documents and interviewed 22 purposively selected key informants. Results In Romania, several politically and economically motivated policies have led to persistent medicine shortages. Following the 2007 accession to the EU, fierce competition led to a decline in domestic medicine production. Soon after, the government introduced a tax on reimbursed medicines to support the national health budget. Prior to the 2015 elections, medicine prices were abruptly lowered to provide voters with the cheapest medicine in Europe. The low prices incentivised traders to buy medicines in Romania and sell them elsewhere in the EU. The high taxes and low prices led manufacturers to withdraw medicines from the market and impose product quotas to limit parallel trading. The accumulated effect of these market responses translated into persistent shortages of essential medicine, which have pushed patients and health professionals to unregulated markets with a high risk of exposure to falsified medicine. Conclusion Strategies against falsified medicine with a narrow focus on safeguarding quality in the regulated supply are insufficient. To protect patients, governments must also ensure that patients have access to affordable medicines, as shortages provide an opportunity for those selling fake products.  © 2023 Author(s)."

A significant number of news stories are fake and are published to serve certain purposes and ideologies. The present study examines how Arab social media users respond to fake news in Arabic in reference to van Dijk’s concept of the ideological square. A dataset of fake news was collected from Twitter, now X platform, comprising tweets on various events. After preprocessing, a topic-modeling algorithm was applied to the dataset to reveal its latent aspects. Instances of the featured topics in the dataset were then analyzed in accordance with the sociocognitive approach to critical discourse analysis. The findings demonstrate that fake news was leveraged to promote ideological struggle between social groups. Some social media users may interact with misinformation without evaluating its credibility and, therefore, express ideologically loaded beliefs for or against the subject matter of the news story. Fake news stories were also exploited for business and marketing. Misinformation’s discourse structure involves ideological polarization, self-identification and goal-description, and violates norms and values. The discursive structure and strategies revolve around the ideological square. © The Author(s) 2023."

Traditional heuristic algorithms for influence maximization suffer from different issues, such as accuracy descent and information loss during network exploration. Besides, recently proposed deep learning-based approaches cannot extract the in-depth structural information of social networks well. In light of these problems, we propose a novel heuristic method called the network dynamic GCN influence maximization algorithm based on the leader fake labeling mechanism. To exploit the in-depth network topology information for the influence maximization task, we design a network dynamic GCN that owns adaptive layer numbers in terms of different network scales to obtain node representations. Then, considering that there are few labels in the network or the labels are irrelevant to the task of influence maximization, we establish a leader fake labeling mechanism to automatically generate node labels that are helpful to seed nodes selecting for model training. Finally, a heuristic method based on the Mahalanobis distance is developed to quickly select influential seed nodes with the learned node representations. Three real-world datasets are used in our experiments, and the experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm has a better performance for seed set identification under the premise of high efficiency compared with some latest heuristic influence maximization algorithms.  © 2014 IEEE."

On the one hand, the rise of deep face manipulation has inspired a series of applications, including video making and advertising marketing. On the other hand, because face manipulation technology is usually open source or packaged as APPs for free distribution, it makes the threshold of tampering technology lower, resulting in the proliferation of fake videos. Moreover, when face manipulation technology is maliciously used by criminals to produce fake news, especially for important military and political officials, it will guide and intervene in public opinion, posing a great threat to national security and social stability. Therefore, the research on deep face forgery detection technology is particularly important. Hence, it is necessary to summarize the existing research to rationally guide deep face manipulation and detection technology.[Progress] Nowadays, deep face manipulation technology can be roughly divided into four types, namely, identity swapping, face reenactment, face editing, and face synthesis. Deepfakes bring real-world identity swapping to a new level of fidelity. The region-aware face-swapping network provides the identity information of source characters from local and global perspectives, making the generated faces more natural. In the field of facial reenactment, Wav21ip uses pretrained lip synchro models as expert models, encouraging the model to generate natural and accurate lip movements. In the field of face editing, FENeRF, a three-dimensional perception generator based on a neural radiation field, aligns semantic, geometric, and texture information in spatial domain and improves the consistency of the generated image between different perspectives while ensuring that the face can be edited. In the field of face synthesis, Anyface proposes a cross-modal distillation module for the alignment of language and visual representation, realizing the use of text information to generate more diversified face images. Deep face forgery detection technology can be roughly divided into image-level forgery detection and video-level forgery detection methods. In the image-level methods, SBI proposes a self-blended technique to generate realistic fake face images with data augmentation, effectively improving the generalization ability of the model. M2TR proposes a multimodal and multi-scale Transformer model to detect local artifacts at different levels of the image in spatial. Frequency domain features are also added as auxiliary information to ensure the forgery detection ability of the model for highly compressed images. In the video-level methods, RealForensics learns the natural correspondence between the face and audio in a real video in a self-supervised way, enhancing the generalization and robustness of the model.[Conclusions and Prospects] Presently, deep face manipulation and detection technologies are rapidly developing, and various corresponding technologies are in the process of continuous update and iteration. First, this survey reviews the deep face manipulation and detection methods and discusses their strengths and weaknesses. Second, the common datasets and the evaluation results of different manipulation and detection methods are summarized. Finally, the main challenges of face manipulation and fake detection are discussed, and the possible research direction in the future is pointed out. © 2023 Press of Tsinghua University.

Mainly due to supply shortages, counterfeit vaccines, fake documentation, and alleged cures to illegal portfolios, have been offered on darkweb marketplaces (DWMs) with important public health consequences. We aimed to profile key DWMs and vendors by presenting some in-depth case studies. Methods: A non-systematic search for COVID-19 products was performed across 118 DWMs. Levels of activity, credibility, content, COVID-19 product listings, privacy protocols were among the features retrieved. Open web fora and other open web sources were also considered for further analysis of both functional and non functional DWMs. Collected data refers to the period between January 2020 and October 2021. Results: A total of 42 relevant listings sold by 24 vendors across eight DWMs were identified. Four of these markets were active and well-established at the time of the study with good levels of credibility. COVID-19 products were listed alongside other marketplace content. Vendors had a trusted profile, communicated in English language and accepted payments in cryptocurrencies (Monero or Bitcoin). Their geographical location included the USA, Asia and Europe. While COVID-19 related goods were mostly available for regional supply, other listings were also shipped worldwide. Interpretation: Findings emerging from this study rise important questions about the health safety of certain DWMs activities and encourage the development of targeted interventions to overcome such new and rapidly expanding public health threats.

All these activities rely heavily on owning masses of fake accounts, and to create new accounts efficiently, malicious registrants use automated registration bots with anti-human verification services that can easily bypass a website's security strategies. In this paper, we take the first step toward understanding the underground ecosystem of account registration bots, and in particular, the anti-human verification services they use. From a comprehensive analysis, we determined the three most popular types of anti-human verification services. We then conducted experiments on these services from an attacker's perspective to verify their effectiveness. The results show that all can easily bypass the security strategies website providers put in place to prevent fake registrations, such as SMS verification, CAPTCHA and IP monitoring. We further estimated the market size of the underground registration ecosystem, placing it at about US $4.8M-128.1 million per year.

Such malicious URL posted by fake users in Social Networking Services (SNS) is hard to identify. Therefore, there occurs a need to detect such fraudulent URLs in SNS. In order to detect such URLS, this paper proposes a SNS Fraudulent Detection (SFD) scheme. The proposed SFD scheme includes a Deterministic Finite Automata Tokenization (DFA-T) and Web Crawler (WC) based Neuro Fuzzy System (WC-NFS). DFA-T extracts the URL features and calculates a Penalty Score (PS) based on the malicious words in the extracted URL. The DFA extracted URL features with PS are fed into WC-NFS. Subsequently, the WC fetches the numeric WC-Index (WCI) value from the URLs which are added to the WC-NFS. The existing URL data set is used to identify the malicious web links and suitable machine learning techniques are used to identify the malicious URLs. From the experimental results, it is found that the proposed SFD provides 92.6 % accuracy in classifying the benign from malicious URLs when compared with the existing methods.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

Unregulated drug markets lead to samples with unexpected and variable contents. A retrospective data analysis of Zurich's DCS was performed to determine the nature of these samples. Methods: This study aims to investigate the qualitative and quantitative properties of 16,815 customer-provided psychoactive drug samples analyzed chemically through the DCS in Zurich from 1st January 2011 to 31st December 2021. The main analytical method utilized for characterizing these substances was high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Data sets are summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: There was a 2.5-fold increase in the number of tested samples over the past decade. An overall proportion of 57.9% (weighted mean) of samples within our database demonstrates unexpected analytical findings and additional low sample contents during the observation period. Substantial differences in quality and quantity between substance groups were detected and an increase of sample quality and content over time was demonstrated. Conclusions: Chemical analysis reveals that over half of substances acquired from unregulated drug markets analyzed through DCS in Zurich are with low qualitative and quantitative properties, which may expose users to risks. Based on longitudinal analyses over a decade, this study contributes to the body of evidence that DCS may potentially manipulate unregulated drug markets towards providing better quality substances, as well as may stabilize these markets over time. The necessity for drug policy changes to make this service accessible in further settings was highlighted, as DCS still often take place in legal grey zones.

The purpose of this study was to investigate how the pandemic shaped social media listening in Finland's public sector organisations and how these organisations aligned their listening and strategic communication to address emerging questions, news (real and fake) and rumours during the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Building on a theoretical background from strategic communication, organisational listening, digital marketing and public sector communication, qualitative interview data included communicators (N = 14) from all central Finnish public sector organisations in charge of COVID-19 communication. Findings were themed and analysed qualitatively to understand the level of alignment of strategic communication on social media. Findings: The findings revealed that the pandemic had strained public sector organisations' communication capabilities, forcing them to align their processes and resources reactively to enable useful content and limit false/misleading content. The results confirmed that organisational listening remained somewhat unaligned. A dual role of public sector communication as speakers but increasingly as listeners was highlighted.

Concepts have ontological and epistemological repercussions, and thus far, disinformation scholarship has failed to engage them. Partly because scholars are studying disinformation even when they do not use that word to label their work, the article argues that explicit disinformation scholarship tends to neglect neighboring fields and scholars—the second critique. By most definitions of the term disinformation, neighbors are researching the same object domain, which could provide rich resources for scholars newly attracted to “disinformation”: propaganda, public relations, promotional culture, political consulting/marketing, and post-truth studies. It discusses the neighbors’ deep historical and contemporary research on for-hire deceptive communication, including that pertaining to social media. The third critique argues that disinformation scholarship has a cryptonormative tendency, evident in language of disorder, threats, dysfunctions, and pollution; it therefore needs more overt normative justification (or defense of anti-normativity). The cryptonormativity also entails a tendency toward ethnocentrism. The article ends by questioning whether disinformation is conceptually suitable for the theoretical work with which it tasks itself. © The Author(s) 2024."

One common type of manipulative behaviour is astroturfing. It happens when an entity artificially creates an impression of widespread support for a product, policy, or concept, when in reality only limited support exists. Online astroturfing is often considered to be just like any other coordinated inauthentic behaviour; with considerable discussion focusing on how it aggravates the spread of fake news and disinformation. This paper shows that astroturfing creates additional problems for social media platforms and the online environment in general. The practice of astroturfing exploits our natural tendency to conform to what the crowd does; and because of the importance of conformity in our decision-making process, the negative consequences brought about by astroturfing can be much more far-reaching and alarming than just the spread of disinformation. © The Author(s) 2022."

Therefore, understanding consumer behavior when they are exposed to SM fake news is important.

Conversely, vendors’ signal credibility and consumers’ perceived vendor reputation diminish the effect of SM fake news on consumer trust. Our research model is empirically validated via an online survey. The results support these three moderation effects. In addition, the results indicate that consumers’ brand bias is a direct predictor of consumer purchase behavior.

It is a conflict that companies are wary of being drawn into and which has only recently attracted significant attention from marketing scholars, albeit through explorations of the more specific topic of brand activism. Brand activist campaigns are mostly adopted by companies seeking to express their values and their solidarity with progressive social causes and/or to resonate with younger consumer audiences for whom such causes are important. Such strategies pose risks to brands and their managers, and a misjudged incursion into a culture war battle can result in a backlash from both critics and supporters. Becoming “fake news” targets, accusations of inauthenticity, and being targeted with punitive measures by policymakers in retaliation for taking a stand are among the brand activism risks companies face.

Does this risk patients’ health? Readiness to implement FMD, and prevalence of SFs vs. regulator detection were assessed. Research design and methods: A total of 12,040 primary care pharmacies across England were invited (April 2021–March 2022). Respondent postcodes were used to extract deprivation scores. Information request was placed with the medicine’s agency. Survey findings were used to calculate probability and power of a simulated trial. Results: A total of 208 participants responded: Of the seven who identified SFs, all but one reported it; 61% were ready to implement FMD, 74.1% had adequate resources, 54.8% expected improved patient safety, and 17.8% had ever reported SFs. SFs were prevalent in deprived areas. Bayesian simulation shows 438 (p = 0.030) incidences with a 3% probability of SFs prevalence. The agency identified 15,238 SFs units in the supply chain (2019 and 2020). Results are credible, reliable, and generalisable, with corroborated longitudinal persistence. Conclusions: FMD or equivalent processes need to be urgently reinstated. Deprived children may be more affected. Pharmacists are worried about liability.

Vaccinating is an effective means of addressing the pandemic threat. The government of India has implemented a massive vaccination drive to save its citizens from the deadly virus. However, the effort has faced multiple challenges, including vaccine hesitancy. This research understands respondents’ perspectives on factors contributing to the lower vaccination uptake in Gujarat, India. Forty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted through convenience sampling representing different demographic backgrounds. Factors influencing vaccine adoption included religious leadership, political leadership and the government, and fear of side effects, especially among children and those with co-morbidities, resulting primarily from fake news and misinformation circulated through social media. Compared with nine countries from across the world, the study found similarities to vaccine hesitancy from misinformation and the fear of side effects among children. In contrast, the role of government and the influence of religious and political leaders was considered positive. The study recommends strategies to overcome people’s apprehensions about the adoption of vaccination. These include offering incentives, providing positive peer-to-peer communication, recruiting influencers such as religious and community leaders and early adopters such as the elderly population to endorse vaccination, targeting youth through social media, and reaching rural sections by involving NGOs and social service groups. © 2022 by the authors.

The model input of this approach is the specification of the flow of information. This enables the representation of (i) reliable information, (ii) noise, and (iii) disinformation, in a unified framework. Because the approach is designed to characterize the dynamics of the behavior of people, it is possible to quantify the impact of information control, including those resulting from the dissemination of disinformation. It is shown that if a decision maker assigns an exceptionally high weight on one of the alternative realities, then under the Bayesian logic their perception hardly changes in time even if evidences presented indicate that this alternative corresponds to a false reality. Thus, confirmation bias need not be incompatible with Bayesian updating.

With the increasing prevalence of stealth marketing, mis- and disinformation, polarization online and offline, microtargeting and clickbait, educators are faced with new questions about how to teach about the media ecosystem and what to include in their curriculum. In this paper, we review important elements of the contemporary media ecosystem and provide an overview of the history of media literacy. We then define literacy and media literacy before highlighting the various sub-disciplines of media literacy that have branched out to focus on a particular media form or approaches to media literacy. Although the various branches of media literacy focus on different media forms, they nonetheless share similar progressions in their development as well as future challenges. We conclude by outlining the key challenges and gaps that media literacy educators, advocates, and researchers must contend with in order for the field to progress both theoretically and in practice. This includes emotional aspects of media and consumption, better understanding and addressing the media literacy needs of marginalized peoples and adults, moving beyond checklists and cognitive approaches to media literacy, and developing more timely ways to engage with the media and information, such as lateral reading or mindfulness. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, strong Farmers' Economic Institutions include farming activities from upstream to downstream, nurtured and developed by farmers relying on local wisdom. Thus, Farmer's Economic Institution must be adapted to the culture, regional potential, market potential and policies of the applicable organic farming system, to increase the capacity. This study therefore aims to identify internal and external factors in managing organic rice marketing within Pangudi Bogo Farmer Group, in Boyolali District, using a qualitative descriptive data analysis, with IFE, EFE, IE, and SWOT matrix. According to the IFE matrix analysis, adequate facilities and infrastructure are the greatest strengths, while the biggest weaknesses are unattractive product packaging and labels. In addition, the greatest opportunity is the development of information and communication technology to support marketing activities, while the biggest threat is fake organic product claims. Also, the IE matrix analysis shows the Pangudi Bogo farmer group's marketing position is in quadrant V, meaning a keep and maintain strategy is required.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

The market for counterfeit drugs used in sexual medicine, most notably type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE5i), is rapidly growing. Aims: To report the health risks associated with the use of counterfeit medications, the reasons driving their use, and the strategies enacted to contain this phenomenon. Methods: A systematic scoping review of the literature regarding counterfeit PDE5i was carried between January and June 2021, then updated in August 2021. Main Outcome Measure: We primarily aimed to clarify the main drivers for counterfeit PDE5i use, the health risks associated, and the currently available strategies to fight counterfeiters. Results: One hundred thirty-one records were considered for the present scoping review. Production of fake PDE5i is highly lucrative and the lacking awareness of the potential health risks makes it a largely exploitable market by counterfeiters. Adulteration with other drugs, microbial contamination and unreliable dosages make counterfeit medications a cause of worry also outside of the sexual medicine scope. Several laboratory techniques have been devised to identify and quantify the presence of other compounds in counterfeit medications. Strategies aimed at improving awareness, providing antitampering packaging and producing non-falsifiable products, such as the orodispersible formulations, are also described. Clinical implications: Improving our understanding of the PDE5i counterfeit phenomenon can be helpful to promote awareness of this issue and to improve patient care. Strengths & Limitations: Despite the systematic approach, few clinical studies were retrieved, and data concerning the prevalence of counterfeit PDE5i use is not available on a global scale. Conclusion: The counterfeit phenomenon is a steadily growing issue, with PDE5i being the most counterfeited medication with potentially large harmful effects on unaware consumers.

Results: Electoral marketing influences voters’ behavioral reactions, which influence the number of votes for all political positions. The spent on the campaign, dissemination of negative fake news, and political spectrum of the candidate are, respectively, the main predictors of voters’ behavioral reactions. The number of social network followers, voting intentions, being perceived as captivating, famous, and talented for politics, and motivations to vote due to proposals and renewal are, respectively, the main predictors of the number of votes received. But the prediction depends on the position pleaded. For example, for the republic's presidency, being perceived as famous and captivating by voters becomes essential.

On the one hand, a boom of services seems to have evolved, accelerated by the opportunities of marketing intelligence. It has contributed to the optimization of customer experiences, e.g., supported by mobile, personalized, and customized marketing services. On the other hand, (digital) self-services are likely to pervert the term “service”. Lifecycle marketing, including annoying marketing communication in real-time, automated price adjustment and programmatic advertising based on artificial intelligence, affects the vision of fully standardized marketing automation. Additionally, there are incentives to pollute the digital information in order to manufacture opinions. Fake news is one popular example. This leads to the (open) question if marketing intelligence means service boom or bust of marketing. This contribution aims to elaborate the boom-and-bust aspects of marketing intelligence and suggests a trade-off.

As a consequence, 'bad actors' are increasingly exploiting these platforms, which is a key challenge for their administrators, businesses and society in general. The spread of fake news is a classical example of the abuse of social networks by these bad actors. While some have advocated for stricter policies to control the spread of misinformation in social networks, this often happens in detriment of their democratic and organic structure. In this paper, we aim to limit the influence of a target group in a social network via the removal of a few users/links. We formulate the influence limitation problem in a data-driven fashion, by taking into account past propagation traces. More specifically, our algorithms find critical edges to be removed in order to decrease the influence of a target group based on past data. The idea is to control the diffusion processes while minimizing the amount of disturbance in the network structure. Moreover, we consider two types of constraints over edge removals, a budget constraint and also a, more general, set of matroid constraints. These problems lead to interesting challenges in terms of algorithm design. For instance, we are able to show that influence limitation is APX-hard and propose deterministic and probabilistic approximation algorithms for the budgeted and the matroid version of the problem, respectively. Experiments show that the proposed approaches outperform several baselines. © 1989-2012 IEEE."

In Kenya, seed companies have started marketing their seed using novel packaging features to signal product quality and authenticity. We use experimental auctions with smallholder farmers in Kenya's Nyanza Province to assess (1) farmer willingness to pay (WTP) for hybrid seed from different sources with different packaging features and (2) how WTP is affected by training on best practices for purchasing seed. We elicited demand for two popular types of hybrid maize seed and a familiar local (non-hybrid) seed. For each hybrid, we examined WTP for one bag purchased directly from the seed company and three bags purchased from local retailers, two of which had compromised packaging. Across both the control and training groups, participants were willing to pay a 15% premium, on average, for bags purchased directly from the seed company compared to mint condition bags purchased from local retailers. Without the training on purchasing seed, farmers did not discount compromised bags; however, farmers who received the training, were willing to pay 15% less for compromised bags.

They are deeply loved by consumers for their unique qualities and advantages such as being close-fitting, warm, fluffy and soft, breathable and healthful. With the increasing costsof raw materials and labor, the production costs of enterprises also increase, so some enterprises use low-quality raw materials as high-grade and high-quality products to improve the profit margin. There emerge a series of undesirable phenomena such as simulating medium-long silk floss with short silk floss, simulating long silk floss with medium-long silk floss, and simulating high-quality doupion long silk floss with low-quality pelettes long silk floss, as well as the phenomenon of adding chemicals to silk floss, and offering shoddy and fake commodities, which has seriously reduced the quality of silk quilts. The most important factor in judging the price and quality of silk quilts is the length of silk floss. The original national standard GB/T 24252 - 2009 for silk quilts neither quantifies the length index of silk floss in the quality of silk quilt nor limits the added chemical substances. Therefore, relevant departments have revised the national standard for silk quilts. The newly implemented standard GB/T 24252 - 2019 for silk quilts adds the assessment index of the length of silk floss. Since the implementation of the standard, some manufacturing and marketing enterprises of silk quilts do not understand the standard and fail to correctly mark the length of silk floss according to the standard, resulting in the product quality being not qualified for the new silk quilt standard. Some testing institutions are unfamiliar with the production process of silk floss, resulting in misjudgment of the length of silk floss, and affecting the judgment and evaluation of the quality. It is of great importance for enterprises to understand and unify the length of silk floss and for testing institutions to be familiar with the production process and correctly identify and determine the length. This paper analyzes the length detection of mulberry silk floss and tussah silk floss in the national standard GB/T 24252 -2019 for silk quilts and the industrial standard FZ/T 40009 -2017 test method for fiber length of silk floss. Through the analysis of the standard FZ/T 40009 -2017 test method for the length of silk floss, this paper points out the difficulties in the identification of three types of silk floss length forms in the standard: the identification of man-made long silk floss and machine-made long silk floss; the identification of the reticular medium-long silk floss from the pelettes of opened cocoon and that from waste silk opening; the identification of reticular short silk floss and combed floc short silk floss. Combined with the raw materials, production and processing technology and characteristics of thelength of silk floss, the difficult points of silk floss length are identified, analyzed and supplemented. Through the detailed analysis of the classification of silk floss, the raw materials and production technology used for silk floss and the characteristics of silk floss, five standard methods for the identification and characterization of silk floss length are summarized. With the continuous improvement of people's living standards and demands, high-quality, high-performance and high-price silk quilts will enter ordinary people's homes. Through the analysis of the quality grade, silk type and silk floss length quality of silk quilts, it is found that the higher grade of silk quilts, the longer the silk floss, the better the quality, the higher the price and the better the consumer experience. The analysis and supplement of silk quilt standards in this paper provide technical guidance for manufacturing and marketing enterprises to understand the silk quilt standards and correctly mark the length of silk floss. It can also help inspection institutionsget familiar with the production process, correctly identify and judge the length of silk floss, and help consumers purchase high-quality silk quilts at reasonable prices. © 2022 China Silk Association.

Most of the work focused on maximizing the spread of influence or the diffusion of information (e.g., a viral marketing message) starting from a set of initial nodes called seeds. Unfortunately, malicious users can use these algorithms to spread negative messages, consisting of racist or hateful contents, misinformation, or fake news. We consider a scenario in which a malicious entity, the attacker, spreads a negative message and another entity, the defender, tries to mitigate the effects of the negative message by spreading another message that invalidates the former with some evidence that its content is wrong. The attacker has the advantage of playing first, knowing that the defender will play afterward, while the defender has the advantage of observing the attacker's spread. We define two optimization problems: the attacker, who is aware of the defender and her budget, selects a set of seeds to maximize the number of influenced nodes; when the attacker's diffusion process is finished, the defender selects her own seeds with the aim of minimizing the number of nodes that remain influenced by the attacker. © 2021 ACM."

In the 1950s, the tobacco industry set the example, which the pharmaceutical industry followed. Since then, the latter has been regularly condemned for illegal marketing, misrepresentation of experimental results, dissimulation of information about the dangers of drugs, and considered as criminal. Therefore, this study was conducted to show that knowledge is powerfully manipulated by harmful corporations, whose goals are: 1/financial; 2/to suppress our ability to make choices to acquire global control of public health. Methods: Pharmaceutical industry techniques for manipulating science and COVID-19 reporting were reviewed. Several sources of official documents were used: PubMed; National Institutes of Health resources; pharmaceutical companies; policy documents; national newspapers and news agencies; and books by prominent professionals (scientific and legal). A few studies have not been published in peer-reviewed journals; however, they have been conducted by reputable scientists in their respective fields. Results: Since the beginning of COVID-19, we can list the following methods of information manipulation which have been used: falsified clinical trials and inaccessible data; fake or conflict-of-interest studies; concealment of vaccines' short-term side effects and total lack of knowledge of the long-term effects of COVID-19 vaccination; doubtful composition of vaccines; inadequate testing methods; governments and international organizations under conflicts of interest; bribed physicians; the denigration of renowned scientists; the banning of all alternative effective treatments; unscientific and liberticidal social methods; government use of behavior modification and social engineering techniques to impose confinements, masks, and vaccine acceptance; scientific censorship by the media. Conclusion: By supporting and selecting only the one side of science information while suppressing alternative viewpoints, and with obvious conflicts of interest revealed by this study, governments and the media constantly disinform the public. Consequently, the unscientifically validated vaccination laws, originating from industry-controlled medical science, led to the adoption of social measures for the supposed protection of the public but which became serious threats to the health and freedoms of the population.  © 2022 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Surgical Neurology International."

Some of those that attract the most attention from researchers are fake news and post-truth, electoral processes, media coverage or pop politics. On the other hand, the framing theory, despite its long trajectory, continues to be one of the most frequent conceptual and methodological paradigms for the study of this kind of communication. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize the articles published in Ibero-American communication journals indexed in Scimago Journal Rank (2015-2019), and where both aspects converged. For this, content analysis was used as a meta-research tool, thanks to which 175 variables were applied for the observation of a sample of 100 manuscripts. The main findings reveal an increasing production, although the average impact decreases as of 2016, and led by Spanish journals and authors affiliated with universities of this country. The works are eminently empirical and focused on the observation, also through content analysis, of the information disclosed in the press and social networks; a low-cost practice given the scarcity of additional financing declared by the authors. Finally, the most recurrent theme focuses on marketing, campaigns, and electoral debates. © 2022 Fundacion para la Investigacion Social Avanzada. All rights reserved."

They help build trust and loyalty and generally define what separates the goods from others. The competition is so high that at times the company is forced to rely on the third party in producing deceptive reviews to influence readers’ opinions and hence to enhance the sales. This misleads the ethics and purpose of online shopping. This paper proposes a model to identify fake product reviews. The model uses Naive Bayes classifier and Support Vector Machine to classify the fake and genuine reviews. The model uses a set of parameters such as length of the review, usage of personal pronouns, nature of the review, verified purchase status, rating of the review and the type of the product to extract the features for the classification. The experimental results show that the model is working efficiently with a high classification accuracy rate. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Unfortunately, existing privacy-enhancing tools are not always effective against online advertising and tracking. We propose HARPO, a principled learning-based approach to subvert online behavioral advertising through obfuscation. HARPO uses reinforcement learning to adaptively interleave real page visits with fake pages to distort a tracker's view of a user's browsing profile. We evaluate HARPO against real-world user profiling and ad targeting models used for online behavioral advertising. The results show that HARPO improves privacy by triggering more than 40% incorrect interest segments and 6× higher bid values. HARPO outperforms existing obfuscation tools by as much as 16× for the same overhead. HARPO is also able to achieve better stealthiness to adversarial detection than existing obfuscation tools. HARPO meaningfully advances the state-of-the-art in leveraging obfuscation to subvert online behavioral advertising. © 2022 29th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, NDSS 2022.

A relevant issue in those networks involves the identification of key influencers. These players have an important role on viral marketing strategies and message propagation, including political propaganda and fake news. In effect, an important way to fight malicious usage on social networks is to understand their properties, their structure and the way messages propagate. This paper proposes a new index for analyzing message propagation in social networks, based on the network topological nature and the influential power of the message. The new index characterizes the strength of each node as a launcher of the message, dividing the nodes into launchers and non-launchers. This division is most evident when the viral power of the message is high. Together with other known metrics, launcher individuals can assist to select efficient influencers in a social network. For instance, instead of choosing a strong member according to its degree in the network (number of followers), we may previously select those belonging to the launchers group and then look for the lowest degree members contained therein. These members are probably cheaper (on financial incentives) but still guarantying almost the same influence effectiveness as the largest degree members. We discuss this index using a number of real-world social networks available in known datasets repositories. © 2021"

Initially, users are redirected to phishing websites through various social and technical routing techniques. Users being ignorant about the illegitimacy of the website, provide their personal information such as user id, password, credit card details, bank account details to name a few. These details are stolen by the phishers and later used for either financial gains, or to tarnish a brand image or even more grave crimes like identity theft. Many phishing detection and prevention techniques are proposed in the literature; however, there is much scope in the cyber-security world with the advent of smart machine learning and deep learning methods. In this research, we explored computer vision techniques and build deep learning and machine learning classifiers to detect phishing website and their brands. Some of the experiments include Transfer Learning and Representation Learning techniques by utilizing various off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to extract image features. It is observed that DenseNet201 outperforms all experiments conducted as well as the existing state-of-the-art on the dataset used, proving the hypothesis that Convolutional neural networks are an effective solution for extracting relevant features from phishing webpages for phishing detection classification. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Fulfilling the “hard responsibility” of product quality based on technical standards and the “soft responsibility” of product quality based on business ethics is an important principle stimulating the benign interaction and continuous progress of technological innovation and business ethics, and realizing a balanced development of enterprises and society, which could promote positive brand and enterprise image to both stakeholders and consumers, helping consumers choose high-quality products in the market and social competition. However, the strange marketing phenomena of “salable fake goods” and “unsalable quality goods” shows that no systematic marketing strategies have been identified to date, that enterprises could adopt to effectively promote the recognition of consumers and turn them into a loyal customer group and have a stable market share. Based on customer buying behavior theory, cognitive consistency theory, signal theory, and social identity theory, this study explored the influencing mechanism of quality responsibility on brand loyalty of consumers and the mediating role of corporate reputation and brand identification, using 224 valid questionnaires from 16 communities (residents) in Shanxi and Henan provinces of China tested by SPSS 20.0 and AMOS 25.0. Results show that quality responsibility has a significant positive influence on brand behavior loyalty and brand attitude loyalty, and both corporate emotional reputation and brand identification play mediating roles in the relationship between quality responsibility and brand behavior loyalty, and quality responsibility and brand attitude loyalty. Additionally, corporate cognitive reputation only plays a mediating role in the relationship between quality responsibility and brand behavior loyalty.

The emergence of Internet celebrity brings new vitality to CBEC, as they build a bridge of trust between brand merchants and consumers. At the same time, the more complex CBEC supply chain with Internet celebrity involved needs to be integrated. This study propose a business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) supply–demand docking business model and accordingly four incentive mechanisms (namely high-quality production incentive, Internet celebrity marketing incentive, equity sharing incentive and cooperative voting mechanism) to achieve the CBEC supply chain vertical integration. Our analysis shows that a higher commission proportion of CBEC platform results in lower quality improvement level and demand, and higher sale price and consumer experience level. We also find that joint decision-making actually realizes Pareto improvement of decentralized decision-making.

In this article, I provide a synopsis of a case Amazon settled against two dupe influencers who used social media to promote the sale of counterfeit luxury products. I highlight the persistent challenge of luxury counterfeits sold online, the consumer complicity of obtaining luxury fakes, and the problem of discerning a knockoff from a counterfeit product. Dupe influencers leverage trust with their followers and use social media tactics, such as unboxing videos and designer haul promotions, to peddle luxury fakes.

Although brand selfies of average consumers are generally perceived as credible, some consumers generate fake brand selfie pictures. Furthermore, viewers evaluate credibility of a brand selfie based on its composition, as well as its components such as brand, person and context. Even though marketers need to choose reasonably credible brand selfies to use for their promotions, little is known about how viewers assess the credibility of a brand selfie. Hence, this research aims to develop a scale to empirically measure brand selfie credibility from the viewer’s perspective, and to identify the antecedents and outcomes of brand selfie credibility. The scale development followed established scale development methods (e.g., Churchill 1979; Gerbing and Anderson 1988). Based on exploratory qualitative and quantitative studies, this research project developed a 9-item scale to measure brand selfie credibility. Three dimensions identified through an exploratory qualitative study and confirmed by two expert panels are: brand selfie image trustworthiness, brand selfie congruence, and brand selfie meaning. This research also finds that brand selfie credibility is influenced by brand-related (consistency of the brand and clarity of the brand), person-related (altruistic motivation), and image-related (positive affect) antecedents. Additionally, brand selfie credibility impacts on purchase intention and positive word-of-mouth. This study provides a tool for marketers to understand consumers’ perception of brand selfies and consumers’ reactions. Marketers can identify how the brand selfie and its credibility can be leveraged for marketing purposes, and to choose credible brand selfie pictures for their marketing communication strategies. This is the first study to develop and validate the measures for brand selfie credibility on social media which contributes to user-generated content, influencer-generated content, photographic credibility and branding literature. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Engagement can be directly measured as the number of seconds after which a consumer skips an advertisement. In this paper, we propose a model to predict video engagement of an advertisement using only a few samples. This allows for early identification of poor quality videos. This can also help identify advertisement frauds where a robot runs fake videos behind the name of well-known brands. We leverage on the fact that videos with high engagement have similar viewing patterns over time. Hence, we can create a similarity network of videos and use a graph-embedding model called DeepWalk to cluster videos into significant communities. The learned embedding is able to identify viewing patterns of fraud and popular videos. In order to assess the impact of a video, we also consider how the view counts increase or decrease over time. This results in a heterogeneous graph where an edge indicates similar video engagement or history of view counts between two videos. Since it is difficult to find labelled samples for ‘fraud’ video, we leverage on a one-class model that can determine ‘fraud’ videos with outlier or abnormal behavior.

The seller either has associates bid in the seller's auctions, or the seller controls multiple fake bidder accounts that are used for shill bidding. We proposed a reputation system referred to as the Shill Score that indicates how likely a bidder is to be engaging in price inflating behaviour in a specific seller's auctions. A potential bidder can observe the other bidders’ Shill Scores, and if they are high, the bidder can elect not to participate as there is some evidence that shill bidding occurs in the seller's auctions. However, if a seller is in collusion with other sellers, or controls multiple seller accounts, the seller can spread the risk between the various sellers and can reduce suspicion on the shill bidder. Collusive seller behaviour impacts one of the characteristics of shill bidding the Shill Score examines; consequently, collusive behaviour can reduce a bidder's Shill Score. This paper extends the Shill Score to detect shill bidding where multiple sellers are working in collusion with each other. We propose the first algorithm to provide evidence of whether groups of sellers are colluding. Based on how tight the association is between the sellers and the level of apparent shill bidding that is occurring in the auctions, a suspect bidder's Shill Score is adjusted appropriately to remove any advantage from seller collusion.

Taxonomy is provided for classifying the propagation problems, and the applications of EC in solving these problems are reviewed. Furthermore, some open issues of social propagation and the potential applications of EC are discussed. This paper contributes to recognizing the problems in application-oriented EC design and paves the way for the development of evolving propagation dynamics. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Numerous viruses are susceptible to contaminate crops during growth, harvesting, handling, marketing and minimally processing, and these steps share one common factor which is human. Different studies showed that viruses might persist on different crops for periods of 2 to 14 days under different conditions such as refrigeration, household and freezing. Little is known on SARS-CoV-2, but preliminary studies showed that this virus might survive 24 hr on cardboard and 72 hr on plastic, materials used in fruits and vegetables packaging. Based on preliminary data, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Certainly, to date there is no scientific evidence that SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted by a contact with, or the ingestion of contaminated fresh or minimally processed fruits and vegetables. However, this risk even though being considered improbable, it cannot be “completely and definitely” discarded or ignored, particularly where the virus is spreading in the word. Some agencies indicated that in case some commodities and handlers are contaminated among the multiple people involved from the farm to the table, a cross-contamination may occur, and the risk of the contamination of food, food contact materials, and packaging from infected but asymptomatic workers should not be discarded even though considered “Very Low = meaning very rare but cannot be excluded.”. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

This book analyses how the users of these social networks, especially those of YouTube and Instagram, become content prescribers, opinion leaders and, by extension, people of influence. What influence capacity do they have? Why are intimate or personal aspects shared with unknown people? Who are the big beneficiaries? How much is vanity and how much altruism? What business is behind these social networks? What dangers do they contain? What volume of business can we estimate they generate? How are they transforming cultural industries? What legislation is applied? How does the legislation affect these communications when they are sponsored? Is the privacy of users violated with the data obtained? Who is the owner of the content? Are they to blame for ""fake news""? In this changing, challenging and intriguing environment, The Dynamics of Influencer Marketing discusses all of these questions and more. Considering this complexity from different perspectives: technological, economic, sociological, psychological and legal, the book combines the visions of several experts from the academic world and provides a structured framework with a wide approach to understand the new era of influencing, including the dark sides of it. It will be of direct interest to marketing scholars and researchers while also relevant to many other areas affected by the phenomenon of social media influence. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, José M. álvarez-Monzoncillo.

Analysis methods for the characteristics of Twitter bots have been developed for third-party researchers who have access limitations to Twitter data. Here, we propose a method for estimating the bot population on Twitter based on a random walk. The proposed method addresses two major problems in estimating the bot population on Twitter based on a random walk. First, the maximum number of retrievable friends or followers of a user per query is limited. Second, there is a certain percentage of private users who do not publish personal content, e.g., friends, followers, and tweets. We conduct a simulation analysis using directed social graph datasets to validate whether the proposed estimator is effective on the real Twitter follow graph. Then, we present three different estimates of the bot population on Twitter using the proposed estimator based on the three sample sequences of 25,000 users collected in 2.5 weeks each. The three estimates consistently suggest that 8%-18% of Twitter users during April-June 2021 are bots.  © 2013 IEEE."

A major concern has been the impact of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and ultra-processed drinks on weight gain and on the risk of several NCDs. These foods, generally high in calories, added sugar, sodium, and unhealthy fats, and poor in fibre, protein, and micronutrients, have extensive negative effects on human health and on the environment (due to their associated carbon emission and water use). There is a growing tendency worldwide, and especially in South America, for food companies to add micronutrients to UPFs to make health claims regarding these products, to which food-regulating authorities refer to fake foods. Although more than 45 countries and smaller subregional or urban entities have created taxes on ultra-processed drinks, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, only a few have adopted taxes on snacks and other UPFs, and none have added major subsidies for truly healthy, fresh or minimally processed food for people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Another major focus has been on developing effective package labelling. A smaller number of countries have selected the most impactful warning labels and linked them with other measures to create a mutually reinforcing set of policies; a few other countries have developed effective school food policies.

To counter the negative impact of social media marketing, some firms have begun hiring people to generate fake reviews which either promote their own products or damage their competitor’s reputation. This study proposes a framework, which takes advantage of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, for the observation of behaviors among spammers. Then, based on the behavior of participants on web forums, the authors build up a post-reply network. The main focus is on the behavior-related features of the reviews, their propagation, and their popularity. The primary objective of this study is to build an effective online spammer detection model and the method detailed in this work can be used to improve the performance of spammer detection models. An experiment is carried out with a real dataset, the results of which indicate that these new features are important for identifying spammers. Finally, random walk clustering is applied to investigate the post-reply network. Some interesting and important features are observed in the interactions between a group of spammers which could be subjected to further research. © 2021 IGI Global. All rights reserved."

Bayesian approaches provide guided exploration via uncertainty estimation, but the applicability is often limited due to over-simplified assumptions. Non-Bayesian bootstrap methods, on the other hand, can apply to complex problems by using deep reward models, but lack a clear guidance to the exploration behavior. It still remains largely unsolved to develop a practical method for complex deep contextual bandits. In this paper, we introduce Guided Bootstrap (GuideBoot), combining the best of both worlds. GuideBoot provides explicit guidance to the exploration behavior by training multiple models over both real samples and noisy samples with fake labels, where the noise is added according to the predictive uncertainty. The proposed method is efficient as it can make decisions on-the-fly by utilizing only one randomly chosen model, but is also effective as we show that it can be viewed as a non-Bayesian approximation of Thompson sampling. Moreover, we extend it to an online version that can learn solely from streaming data, which is favored in real applications. Extensive experiments on both synthetic tasks and large-scale advertising environments show that GuideBoot achieves significant improvements against previous state-of-the-art methods.  Â© 2021 ACM."

The main results suggest that institutional advertising campaigns are clearly focused on social networks and have not been the main tool to fight COVID-19 hoaxes, but rather to inform citizens. Their main characters are anonymous people, followed by affected individuals and health care workers, and these campaigns showed greater intensity during the first months of the pandemic and picked up again in December, due to fear of the consequences of a third wave.

Both original and fake companies are attracted by the lucrative market online; this has ultimately resulted in trading in counterfeit products. Digital marketing is more than just the business of disseminating product information for online sales. It involves content building for marketing, designing of the website, information about the product, customer support tools, chat rooms, online payment system etc. Marketing is a commercial speech and is protected under the fundamental right of freedom of speech and freedom of trade. Misleading and fraudulent statements via marketing to push sale of the product is a wrongful act. To reach customers, while introducing the product or services to customers, some unethical practices are adopted by digital marketers and consumers are deceived and misrepresented to their sites as well as the rights of sellers are violated by such anti-competitive practices. Marketing and selling of counterfeit products are addressed under the trademark laws of various countries such as the USA, the UK, and India. Thus, more focus is on protecting the rights of the owner of the goods than protecting the rights of customers.

Authorship profiling techniques are extensively used in many applications like forensic analysis, security, marketing, education, reputation management, fake profiles prediction, and sentiment analysis. The process of prediction is initially started with identification of suitable stylistic features which differentiates the writing style of authors. Most of the authors are successful to extract good number of stylistic features, but they are not achieved good accuracies for author profiles prediction. Several researchers got good accuracies for profiles prediction when the content-based features like most frequent words, most frequent n-grams of words, part of speech tags, and characters are used. In this paper, the experiment started with the terms which are most frequent in the dataset. It was recognized that the accuracy is not increased for profiles prediction because of irrelevant and redundant terms in the vocabulary set. The experiment continued with feature selection algorithms to identify the best informative features as well as avoiding the redundant features. The documents are represented as vectors by using these top informative features. In this work, we proposed a new feature selection algorithm based on the distributional information of the terms in different classes. Various machine learning algorithms are used in this experiment to assess the efficiency of the proposed feature selection algorithm.

The current estimated number of online users is almost a billion. Today's web traffic has increased by more than a half within a year because of the increase in online activities. More data can be mined with more users performing online activities. Therefore, advertising and marketing administrations need to know how people express their views and their response can improve their business efficiency. Since social media are rooted at diverse scales in various data sources, they are often quite large. Nowadays, people review products online, which plays a vital role in making buying choices by most consumers in digital consumer markets. Spammers often write fake reviews to increase/decrease the value of specific products by taking advantage of online reviews. Past studies have focused on spotting distinct fake reviewer-ids of fake reviews. However, to target and control a specific product's sentiment, fake reviewers create multiple fake ids and work together in groups to write reviews. In this chapter, we address the problem of detecting such groups of fake reviewers. Explicitly, we propose a deep learning-based framework for fake reviewer groups detection data of reviewers using various unsupervised deep learning algorithms such as Self Organizing Maps and Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We perform the hyperparameter optimization of these algorithms on this reviewer graph data using advanced deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and popular machine learning frameworks such as scikit-learn.

Specifically, we look at the marketer-consumer ecosystem and argue that such signaling systems tend to become self-reinforcing, such that the information content becomes orthodoxy; technically, this is known as a homeostatic system. From this perspective, solutions to the dissemination of fake news are the identification of links in signaling systems that can disrupt the homeostatic cycle. Our article is set out as follows. First, we provide a brief overview of fake news and of the primary methods used to counter its spread. Second, we take a systems view on news and its dissemination. Third, we illustrate the self-reinforcing tendency of such systems by means of four case studies. Fourth, we explore what managers can do to manage the marketer-consumer information ecosystem so as to minimize fake news.

There is a limited number of green marketing studies investigating consumers’ perception of greenwashing, while it is naturally important to explore the demand side responses to greenwashing in different industries. Therefore, this paper examines whether and how consumers’ perception of greenwashing in the fast fashion industry impacts their green purchase intention. The study explores the mediating role of perceived risk and the moderating role of consumers’ impulsive buying. In this paper, 433 valid questionnaires are collected from mainland China, and the Partial Least Square-Structural Equation (PLS-SEM) is used to test the hypotheses. We draw the following conclusions: (1) consumers’ perception of greenwashing in the fast fashion industry has a direct negative effect on their green purchase intention; (2) greenwashing perception has an indirect negative effect through consumers’ risk perception, including financial perceived risk and green perceived risk; (3) consumers’ impulsive buying in the fast fashion industry reinforces the positive effect of greenwashing on their financial risk perceptions as a moderating variable. The conclusion of this paper has implications for the sustainable development of China and other emerging economies, which highlights the importance of pursuing information symmetry in green marketing to reduce consumers’ perceived risk and encourages companies to make substantial, sustainable development initiatives. © 2022 by the authors."

These sources have information from both trusted and non-trusted medical sources. Furthermore, the news from these media are spread rapidly. Spreading a piece of deceptive information may lead to anxiety, unwanted exposure to medical remedies, tricks for digital marketing, and may lead to deadly factors. Therefore, a model for detecting fake news from the news pool is essential. In this work, the dataset which is a fusion of news related to COVID-19 that has been sourced from data from several social media and news sources is used for classification. In the first step, preprocessing is performed on the dataset to remove unwanted text, then tokenization is carried out to extract the tokens from the raw text data collected from various sources. Later, feature selection is performed to avoid the computational overhead incurred in processing all the features in the dataset. The linguistic and sentiment features are extracted for further processing. Finally, several state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms are trained to classify the COVID-19-related dataset. These algorithms are then evaluated using various metrics. The results show that the random forest classifier outperforms the other classifiers with an accuracy of 88.50%.

It starts with an examination of problems caused by marketers-disingenuity in decision-making. This is an area where marketing research may be complicit, with research designed, consciously or not, to reinforce a decision already taken or one which is favoured by managers, in decisions, for example, about sampling frames, form of questions or interpretation of results. This issue is not confined to marketing or marketing research but is particularly dangerous for marketing, because it usually concerns information which is sourced, developed, managed and interpreted in ways that cannot just be ""objective"". that is, external information. The discussion then turns to one application of marketing research where interpretation become even more important, forecasting, particularly for new products and high technology and science-based areas, where data from existing customers is relatively weak, so big data cannot be used so powerfully, as most big data is mainly about current and past behaviour of customers. In marketing forecasting-from market size to the prospects for new products and services-the marketing research industry is joined by several other types of suppliers, such as analysts, marketing communications agencies and consultancies (and sometimes joined within firms as the border between marketing research agencies and these other parties has become very fuzzy in the last two decades), all of whom have particular interests which can affect what they forecast. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Len Tiu Wright, Luiz Moutinho, Merlin Stone and Richard P.

This is due to the rapid increase in online marketing transactions, such as selling and purchasing. E-commerce provides a facility for customers to post reviews and comment about the product or service when purchased. New customers usually go through the posted reviews or comments on the website before making a purchase decision. However, the current challenge is how new individuals can distinguish truthful reviews from fake ones, which later deceives customers, inflicts losses, and tarnishes the reputation of companies. The present paper attempts to develop an intelligent system that can detect fake reviews on e-commerce platforms using n-grams of the review text and sentiment scores given by the reviewer. The proposed methodology adopted in this study used a standard fake hotel review dataset for experimenting and data preprocessing methods and a term frequency-Inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) approach for extracting features and their representation. For detection and classification, n-grams of review texts were inputted into the constructed models to be classified as fake or truthful. However, the experiments were carried out using four different supervised machine-learning techniques and were trained and tested on a dataset collected from the Trip Advisor website. The classification results of these experiments showed that naïve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), adaptive boosting (AB), and random forest (RF) received 88%, 93%, 94%, and 95%, respectively, based on testing accuracy and tje F1-score. The obtained results were compared with existing works that used the same dataset, and the proposed methods outperformed the comparable methods in terms of accuracy. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

However, such technologies are often vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Facial image can be faked in various ways: print a photo; record a video; create a high-quality silicone mask, etc. By presenting a fake to the FRS the attacker has an intention of passing himself off as another person, for instance, trying to get an access to a secure computer system. Face Liveliness Detection solves this problem by detecting whether the person in front of the camera is real or fake. In this article, we explore the possibilities of using deep learning technology for face liveliness detection. We consider several models and setting numerous experiments. As datasets for experiments we use various fake images and for each such dataset we obtained evaluation of effectiveness.

A clear example, recently experienced in Colombia, corresponds to the national strike which happened at the time of this research. Due to these unexpected circumstances, colombians experienced the influence news have on decision making that can affect the country, not only economically but politically, and socially. It showed how news can generate fear in people, or even misinform, as is the case of fake news. For these reasons, it is key to determine the relevance a story can have. Predicting the impact, will allow us to pay more attention to those news that can affect people more, avoiding misinformation and fake news. However, the problem is that there is no way of predicting the impact that a press article can have. Therefore, the aim of this work is to implement a machine learning model that allows us to predict, with the best possible accuracy, the virality of online press articles (defining virality as the amount of clicks that an article receives when it is opened). In order to achieve this goal, we followed the CRISP-DM methodology, which focuses on machine learning projects. The best obtained result corresponds to the model where the core of the architecture was based on BERT, a pre-trained model, which, for a pair of press articles headlines, predicted whether the first headline would be more viral than the second one. On the other hand, the evaluation was carried out by comparing the amount of clicks for a pair of articles. For a practitioner point of view, digital marketers can use our results to select the best words for their online marketing campaign.

Network members are often under pressure from incoming information with different sources, such as informative campaigns for increasing awareness, viral marketing, rumours, fake news, or the results of other activities. Messages are often repeated, and such repetition can improve performance in the form of cumulative influence. Repeated messages may also be ignored due to a limited ability to process information. Learning processes are leading to the repeated messages being ignored, as their content has already been absorbed. In such cases, responsiveness decreases with repetition, and the habituation effect can be observed. Here, we analyse spreading processes while considering the habituation effect and performance drop along with an increased number of contacts. The ability to recover when reducing the number of messages is also considered. The results show that even low habituation and a decrease in propagation probability may substantially impact network coverage. This can lead to a significant reduction in the potential for a seed set selected with an influence maximisation method. Apart from the impact of the habituation effect on spreading processes, we show how it can be reduced with the use of the sequential seeding approach. This shows that sequential seeding is less sensitive to the habituation effect than single-stage seeding, and that it can be used to limit the negative impact on users overloaded with incoming messages. © 2021, The Author(s)."

This study explored whether social media users will disclose information or further protect privacy when facing information privacy issues. It studied information security awareness and perceived privacy control while affecting privacy concerns and customer calibration related factors, and finds their privacy management and self-disclosure. This study used questionnaire survey method to understand user data and used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the relationship of various dimensions. The results showed that understanding information security awareness and customer alienation through AI technology has a positive impact on consumers’ privacy concerns. Through privacy management, consumers can indeed reduce their doubts about privacy leakage.

However, the usefulness of online reviews is impeded by fake reviews that give an untruthful picture of product quality. Therefore, detection of fake reviews is needed. Unfortunately, so far, automatic detection has only had partial success in this challenging task. In this research, we address the creation and detection of fake reviews. First, we experiment with two language models, ULMFiT and GPT-2, to generate fake product reviews based on an Amazon e-commerce dataset. Using the better model, GPT-2, we create a dataset for a classification task of fake review detection. We show that a machine classifier can accomplish this goal near-perfectly, whereas human raters exhibit significantly lower accuracy and agreement than the tested algorithms. The model was also effective on detected human generated fake reviews. The results imply that, while fake review detection is challenging for humans, “machines can fight machines” in the task of detecting fake reviews.

This study aimed to explore how this policy has been positioned to bring about changes to address the growing prevalence of diabetes, and to analyse the policy response and the associated challenges involved. Methods: This qualitative study, using Walt and Gilson's policy triangle framework, comprised analysis of 171 organizational documents on the WoD, including government press releases, organizational archives, YouTube videos, newspaper reports and opinion editorials. It also involved interviews with 31 policy actors, who were policy elites and societal policy actors. Results: Findings showed that the WoD policy generated a sense of unity and purpose across most policy actors. Policy actors were cognisant of the thrusts of the policy and have begun to make shifts to align their interests with the government policy. Addressing those with diabetes directly is essential to understanding their needs. Being clear on who the intended targets are and articulating how the policy seeks to support the identified groups will be imperative. Issues of fake news, unclear messaging and lack of regulation of uncertified health providers were other identified problem areas. High innovation, production and marketing costs were major concerns among food and beverage enterprises. Conclusion: While there was greater public awareness of the need to combat diabetes, continuing dialogues with the various clusters of policy actors on the above issues will be necessary.

To raise illegally money, attackers use “click fraud” in which a person will repeatedly click on a specific link with the motive to earn money illegally. Click fraud occurs when a script exploits Internet marketers by repeatedly clicking on a pay-per-click (PPC) advertisement to generate fake charges. There are several models to detect click fraud whenever a person or a computer program clicks on a specific link to check if a person is legal or illegal by calculating click through rate to provide security.

Findings: The findings reveal that the tourist’s information literacy self-efficacy – their ability to find the information they need, use it efficiently and discount fake news – positively influences their perception of hotel safety; and perceived hotel safety increases tourist intention to return to consuming hotel services. Practical implications: The results show how the consumer’s intention to return to using hotel services can be enhanced because of their management of information, especially in a crisis context.

Brands have not only faced reputational losses but also got a dip in their share prices and sales, which affected their financial standing. Hence, it is significant for brands to understand the impact of fake news on behavioral intentions and to strategize to manage the impact. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses several branding and marketing concepts such as brand experience, brand trust, brand credibility, consumer behavioral intentions along with variables suggested by Elaboration Likelihood Model and Heuristic Systematic Model such as personal relevance/involvement. For fake news, news truthfulness, news credibility and source credibility are used. Findings: The results of this study shows that positive brand experience, brand trust, brand credibility help in creating positive behavioral intentions for brands. This study shows that brands focusing on providing positive brand experience have a stronger brand trust and credibility and are affected less by fake news than those brands which do not emphasize on these factors. Practical implications: This paper can assist brand managers in understanding the impact fake news can have on behavioral intentions of consumers. The managers can strategize such that the fake news affects their brands the least. Originality/value: The authors in this paper attempt to fill in the gap in literature, which is to study how the fake news impacts the brands considering the credibility, trust and experience they establish with their customers. The existing literature discusses the generation and dissemination of fake news on social media and its impact on political scenarios and personalities. Also, studies explain the impact of fake news on the financial position of brands, but marketing facets are not tested empirically. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The presence and spread of SF drugs negatively affect (1) patients’ safety and health outcomes, (2) national economy, (3) public trust in the healthcare system, and (4) the international fight against serious health challenges such as malaria and antimicrobial resistance. The objective of the current study was to investigate and provide a snapshot analysis of the evolution and developmental patterns of global research publications on SF products. Methods: A bibliometric approach was adopted using terms such as fake, falsified, counterfeit, substandard, and others. No language restriction was made. The study period was from 1900 up to 2020. The search strategy was validated and implemented using Scopus database. Results: The search strategy retrieved 978 documents authored by 2861 researchers from 100 different countries and published in 421 different journals. The retrieved documents received 11,237 citations (11.5 citations per document) with an H-index of 53. The 978 documents retrieved from Scopus were published from 1961 to 2020, giving an average of 16.6 publications per year. The present study indicated that research on SF medical products: (a) has experienced a steep growth from 2001 to 2012 followed by a steady-state growth; (b) was disseminated in a wide range of journals, mainly in the fields of the pharmaceutical industry, analytical chemistry, public health, infectious diseases, and internal medicine; (c) was published by scholars with diverse and distant geographical backgrounds; (d) was mainly produced in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany; (d) has fragmented research networks and a limited number of researchers per network; (e) has limited cross-country collaboration except for that between the US and the UK in one hand and countries in the Mekong region in the other hand; (f) emphasized on medications related to malaria and sexual stimulants; and (g) received relatively inadequate funding. Conclusions: Research on SF medical products is important and should remain a priority to ensure good quality of medications. Research activity in the field needs to be encouraged in world regions such as Africa and the Middle East where drug regulations are unsatisfactory and cross-border trade of illegal medications is common. © 2021, The Author(s)."

However, research regarding this topic is scarce in China, which has also witnessed the rapid growth of the second-hand market in recent years. In this regard, this study analyzed the motivations and barriers to Chinese consumers’ purchase of second-hand clothes as well as their perceived problems with this industry. Specifically, the study conducted a semi-structured online survey with 127 consumers of three second-hand clothing stores in China. Results show that the vast majority (96%) of the investigated consumers are young people born in the 1990s and 2000s, and they are neither significantly driven by economic nor environmental protection motivations. Instead, their purchase is primarily motivated by treasure-hunting fun. Moreover, past overseas shopping experiences are found to be a significant booster to second-hand clothing consumption. Concerns about poverty association and the sanitation conditions of second-hand clothing are the main purchase barriers for the investigated Chinese young consumers. As for the second-hand clothing market, “unregulated industry” (10.29%), “fake identification” (8.09%), and “sanitation concern” (5.88%) are the three most mentioned problems in China. This study provides second-hand retailors and managers with valuable insights into developing successful marketing tactics to attract customers and improve the second-hand industry's performance in China. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

But all variants have one thing in common: humour. It can be used to hide the seriousness of life or, in this case, everyday scientific life for a brief moment. Moreover, serious social or ethical questions are also met. The GPP, a group of German, Austrian and Swiss Pediatric Pulmonologists (GPP) is a scientific society with regular annual meetings. Unsystematic observations and preliminary data suggest that beer consumption increased by some of the participants during this event. Recently, electronic nose (eNose) devices have been developed as a technology for disease screening using exhaled-breath analysis. Here we addressed the issue, if the eNose can be used to differentiate between real beer and fake beer. Methods In this single-centre experimental study, 12 different real beer types and one fake beer were analyzed with regard to their emittance of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with the eNose as an electronic VOC-sensing technology. Results Every single beer type can be identified by a characteristic VOC-smell print using the eNose. Distinct clusters exist for bottom- and top-fermented ales. Intriguingly, Sylter Hopfen, which is marketed as a champagne-beer and tested as representative of a fake beer, can be clearly differentiated from all other genuine beer types. Conclusion Our study provides the first objective data of beer flavor. In the long term perspective the eNose might help to overcome the agonizing controversy about beer flavors and, consequently, pacify the World. In the short run, however, our results give support to more targeted and reserved beer consumption during our annual meeting, especially since one specific beer shows a very similar pattern to indoor air. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Celebrities sometimes intentionally create misleading posts in OSNs to guide people for commercial or marketing purposes. The intentional phrases from such posts can affect the online rating and even lead to a frenzy shopping. That's part of the reasons that the top social media influencers are targeted by merchants to help promote products. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires that all sponsored posts must be clearly disclosed. However, many influencers do not follow the FTC rules. As a result, people may be misled by the undisclosed sponsorship. In this study, for the first time, we explore the credibility of posts on Instagram and analyze if an influencer complies with the FTC requirements. We build an effective Undisclosed Sponsored Post Detection (USPD) framework based on an ensemble of machine learning classifiers. The USPD framework consists of three main processes: (i) feature extraction, (ii) model construction and (iii) credibility and integrity analysis. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve a high accuracy of 83% for undisclosed sponsored post detection. The proposed framework also takes advantages of the text, user and image features in OSN posts to effectively analyze how much an influencer can be trusted. © 2021 IEEE."

In life, business, sports, and politics, social media facilitates the democratization of ideas like never before. Social media content gives consumers different information sources that they must decipher to discern its trustworthiness and influence in their own opinions. Marketers must be savvy about using social media in their attempts to persuade consumers and build brand equity. As social media has permeated our everyday lives, scholars in various disciplines are actively conducting research into this aspect regarding our way of life. In this scholarly endeavor, marketing has taken a leading role in this research endeavor as a discipline involving human communications and idea persuasion. Thus, rather than considering social media broadly across multiple disciplines, in this monograph, we concentrate on social media analytics in marketing. This monograph comprises the following four sections: • First, we provide an overview of social media and social media analytics (SMA). While much has already been said about social media generally, relatively less has been said about social media analytics. Thus, much of our focus is on SMA in terms of contributing to the current understanding of SMA in the field. • Second, we concentrate on social media analytics in marketing. We discuss practical industry perspectives and examples, as well as recent marketing research by academics. Notably, we show how analytics may be used to address concerns about social media privacy and help detect fake reviews. • Third, we summarize common tools for social media analytics in marketing. These methods can be complex, but they must be mastered for sound SMA practice. They encompass big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, text analytics, and visual analytics. • Fourth, we discuss trends and a future research agenda. We also discuss how SMA might be better integrated into higher education. © 2022 S. Moon and D. Iacobucci"

This paper focuses on the retweeting prediction models for Weibo platform-the largest microblog platform in China. The task includes popularity and retweeter prediction. Popularity prediction models estimate the number of users participating in the cascade by learning from the early retweets, while the retweeter prediction models forecast which users will be more likely to retweet a microblog. Both of them play an important role in online marketing and public opinion security. However, other studies deal with them separately while they are strongly related to each other. On the other hand, content of a microblog plays a crucial role in the diffusion but most models don't invoke it at all. Notice the relationships of the popularity and retweeter prediction, we design a deep learning model, called CD-Diffusion (Context Dependent Diffusion Model), which are able to extract user preference features such as content, retweet time and structural relationships between users, share the same social network, update it iteratively and predict the popularity and retweeter of a microblog. Compared with other models, CD-Diffusion has a significant performance improvement.  © 2022 IEEE."

This study aims to explore when consumers believe fake news, whom they blame for it (e.g. negative attitudes toward brands or SNS) and when they choose to share it. Design/methodology/approach: Data obtained from 80 open-ended, semistructured interviews, conducted with SNS consumers and experts, is analyzed following the principles of grounded theory and the Gioia methodology. Findings: Factors affecting consumers’ perceptions of fake news include skepticism, awareness, previous experience, appeal and message cues. Consumers’ brand- and SNS-related attitudes are affected by consumers’ blame, which is determined by consumers’ perceptions of the vetting efforts, role and ethical obligation of SNS. Consumers’ motives for sharing fake news include duty, retaliation, authentication and status-seeking. Theoretical and practical implications derived from the study’s novel conceptual framework are discussed. Practical implications: This study identifies communication strategies that marketing professionals can use to mitigate and counter the negative effects of fake news.

The impact of public figures in social media is quite big. Fake accounts are created in social media platforms and are used for various purposes like inflating the follower list of a particular account. These accounts also called spam accounts usually post spam messages which are used for marketing certain products or spreading particular agendas. Such accounts can be dangerous as they may alter a normal user's perspective on certain topics. These accounts are used to modify and help in creating a fake sense of popularity which can influence political and social situations. In this project, we try to examine some of the existing methods and approaches for fake Twitter accounts detection. We will make use of a public dataset which contains tweets and account information of both Legitimate accounts as well as spam accounts. We make use of account information to create a classifier which can easily classify whether the given account is a fake account or a legitimate account. We also apply sentiment analysis algorithms on the tweet to find patterns among them. We try to analyse the sentiments behind the tweets of different accounts. Comparing our model with the existing model we will improve the features present in our model. In the process of building a better model, we try to reduce overfitting.

Accompanying this pandemic is a parallel “infodemic,” including the online marketing and sale of unapproved, illegal, and counterfeit COVID-19 health products including testing kits, treatments, and other questionable “cures.” Enabling the proliferation of this content is the growing ubiquity of internet-based technologies, including popular social media platforms that now have billions of global users. Objective: This study aims to collect, analyze, identify, and enable reporting of suspected fake, counterfeit, and unapproved COVID-19–related health care products from Twitter and Instagram. Methods: This study is conducted in two phases beginning with the collection of COVID-19–related Twitter and Instagram posts using a combination of web scraping on Instagram and filtering the public streaming Twitter application programming interface for keywords associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 products. The second phase involved data analysis using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to identify potential sellers that were then manually annotated for characteristics of interest. We also visualized illegal selling posts on a customized data dashboard to enable public health intelligence. Results: We collected a total of 6,029,323 tweets and 204,597 Instagram posts filtered for terms associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 health products from March to April for Twitter and February to May for Instagram. After applying our NLP and deep learning approaches, we identified 1271 tweets and 596 Instagram posts associated with questionable sales of COVID-19–related products. Generally, product introduction came in two waves, with the first consisting of questionable immunity-boosting treatments and a second involving suspect testing kits. We also detected a low volume of pharmaceuticals that have not been approved for COVID-19 treatment. Other major themes detected included products offered in different languages, various claims of product credibility, completely unsubstantiated products, unapproved testing modalities, and different payment and seller contact methods. Conclusions: Results from this study provide initial insight into one front of the “infodemic” fight against COVID-19 by characterizing what types of health products, selling claims, and types of sellers were active on two popular social media platforms at earlier stages of the pandemic. This cybercrime challenge is likely to continue as the pandemic progresses and more people seek access to COVID-19 testing and treatment. This data intelligence can help public health agencies, regulatory authorities, legitimate manufacturers, and technology platforms better remove and prevent this content from harming the public. © Tim Ken Mackey, Jiawei Li, Vidya Purushothaman, Matthew Nali, Neal Shah, Cortni Bardier, Mingxiang Cai, Bryan Liang."

Through an evaluation of existing research, a typology of fake news is presented that considers the possibility that the propagation of fake news about a brand, may be stemming from the brand itself, a previously unexplored field in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper based on extensive literature review on the fields of fake news and knowledge creation, resulting in the creation of a synthesized typology. Findings: The role of power structures greatly influences the ability for a brand to respond to fake news. Externally constructed disinformation is seemingly more difficult for a brand to address, as a result of having limited control over the message. Internally constructed information, while stemming from the brand itself provides the brand with more control, but a greater public distrust as the source of the fake news seems to confirm the disinformation. Practical implications: This paper presents a typology that contrasts the source of the construction of disinformation and the extent to which the facts have been fabricated. Furthermore, this paper provides future researchers with an alternate understanding of the conceptualization of fake news. Originality/value: This paper is the first of its kind to establish a typology of fake news on the basis of the source of construction of disinformation.

However, this problem has become increasingly acute in recent years with the Macquarie Dictionary declaring “fake news” the word of the year in 2016 (Lavoipierre, 2017). The international recognition of fake news as a problem (Pomerantsev and Weiss, 2014; Applebaum and Lucas, 2016) has led to a number of initiatives to mitigate perceived causes, with varying levels of success (Flanagin and Metzger, 2014; Horne and Adali, 2017; Sample et al., 2018). The inability to create a holistic solution continues to stymie researchers and vested parties. A significant contributor to the problem is the interdisciplinary nature of digital deception. While technology enables the rapid and wide dissemination of digitally deceptive data, the design and consumption of data rely on a mixture of psychology, sociology, political science, economics, linguistics, marketing, and fine arts. The authors for this effort discuss deception’s history, both old and new, from an interdisciplinary viewpoint and then proceed to discuss how various disciplines contribute to aiding in the detection and countering of fake news narratives. A discussion of various fake news types (printed, staged events, altered photographs, and deep fakes) ensues with the various technologies being used to identify these; the shortcomings of those technologies and finally the insights offered by the other disciplines can be incorporated to improve outcomes. A three-point evaluation model that focuses on contextual data evaluation, pattern spread, and archival analysis of both the author and publication archives is introduced.

Therefore, substances with therapeutic functions cannot be included in health food, as they are classified as special food and are specifically regulated. The use of health food has increased worldwide in the last few decades. However, illegal activities such as the manufacture and marketing of fake com-modities, false advertising, and fraudulent sales have restricted the sustainable development of the health food industry. In particular, there is much concern regarding health food illegally adulterated with pharmaceuticals and their analogs because of the notable risk to public health. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop accurate and sensitive detection methods for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of such compounds. Many methods have been developed for the determination of adulterants in health food, such as high performance liquid chromatogra-phy (HPLC), high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), direct analysis real-time mass spectrometry (DART-MS), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, in recent years, new features of adulterants in health food have emerged. For example, the chemical compositions of drugs added to health food, including prescription drugs, delisted drugs, drug analogs, and new drugs, are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Furthermore, there has been a change in trend from the addition of large doses of a single com-ponent to the addition of small doses of a class of components or multiple components. These pose great challenges to the identification and measurement of such illegal additives. Detection technologies for new drugs and structurally modified analogs are still scarce; hence, newer methods for non-targeted screening are necessary. Fortunately, several structure elucidation techniques have been introduced, including high-resolution time-of-flight (TOF) MS, infrared spectroscopy, as well as 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. This study sum- marizes the types of drugs that may be illegally added in health food according to their pharma- cological activities related to the claimed efficacy of health food; advances in detection technol- ogies for illegal drugs; and future development prospects. The overall aim is to provide benefi- cial reference for the development of standard methods and for the routine monitoring of health food © 2020. All rights reserved"

It has got potential applications in marketing, forensic analysis, fake profile detection, etc. In recent years, the usage of bi-lingual text has raised due to the global reach of social media tools as people prefer to use language that expresses their true feelings during online conversations and assessments. It has likewise impacted the use of bi-lingual (English and Roman-Urdu) text in the sub-continent (Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh) over social media. To develop and evaluate methods for bi-lingual author profiling, benchmark corpora are needed. The majority of previous efforts have focused on developing mono-lingual author profiling corpora for English and other languages. To fulfill this gap, this study aims to explore the problem of author profiling on bi-lingual data and presents a benchmark corpus of bi-lingual (English and Roman-Urdu) tweets. Our proposed corpus contains 339 author profiles and each profile is annotated with six different traits including age, gender, education level, province, language, and political party. As a secondary contribution, a range of deep learning methods, CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU, are applied and compared on the three different bi-lingual corpora for age and gender identification, including our proposed corpus. Our extensive experimentation showed that the best results for both gender identification task (Accuracy = 0.882, F1-Measure = 0.839) and age identification (Accuracy = 0.735, F1-Measure = 0.739) are obtained using Bi-LSTM deep learning method.

Determining source of the IPs or their authenticity is a key metric to facilitate safe reuse of IPs. Though physical unclonable functions solves this problem for application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) IPs, authentication strategies for reconfigurable IPs (RIPs) or IPs of reconfigurable hardware platforms like field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are still in their infancy. Existing authentication techniques for RIPs that relies on verification of proof of authentication (PoA) mark embedded in the RIP by the RIP producers, leak useful clues about the PoA mark. This results in replication and implantation of the PoA mark in fake RIPs. This not only causes loss to authorized second hand RIP users, but also poses risk to the reputation of the RIP producers. We propose a zero knowledge authentication strategy for safe reusing of RIPs. The PoA of an RIP producer is kept secret and verification is carried out based on traversal times from the initial point to several intermediate points of the embedded PoA when the RIPs configure an FPGA. Such delays are user specific and cannot be replicated as these depend on intrinsic properties of the base semiconductor material of the FPGA, which is unique and never same as that of another FPGA. Experimental results validate our proposed mechanism. High strength even for low overhead ISCAS benchmarks, considered as PoA for experimentation depict the prospects of our proposed methodology. © 2019 IEEE."

In this paper, we focus on the community structure of a social network of social media users as a factor affecting information diffusion among those users. We extract two types of community structures, a flow truss and a cycle truss, from the social network of Twitter users and analyze how these structures affect diffusion via cascades of retweets on Twitter. Our results show that tweets disseminated via inter-community retweets have future popularity about 1.2-fold that of tweets disseminated via intra-community retweets. Our results also show that tweets disseminated within a strongly clustered community tend to have less diffusion than tweets disseminated within a weakly clustered community. These results are found both when extracting via cycle truss and flow truss communities, which suggests that our findings are robust against the definitions of community. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."

Conventional methods for cascade prediction heavily depend on the hypothesis of diffusion models and hand-crafted features. Owing to the significant recent successes of deep learning in multiple domains, attempts have been made to predict cascades by developing neural networks based approaches. However, the existing models are not capable of capturing both the underlying structure of a cascade graph and the node sequence in the diffusion process which, in turn, results in unsatisfactory prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-task learning framework with a novel design of shared-representation layer to aid in explicitly understanding and predicting the cascades. As it turns out, the learned latent representation from the shared-representation layer can encode the structure and the node sequence of the cascade very well. Our experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy and reduce the computational cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery."

A common but unsustainable practice in India is to increase the selling price and then offer a discount on the product. Increasing sales based on fake discount pricing strategy is a primary business development objective in India. The discounts, however, vary across store type and time and are based on product features. The selected databases were collected from the top five Indian e-commerce portals in terms of volume of sales, and from popular brick and motor outlets of tier 2 and tier 3 cities in India. The empirical results indicate that offers based on price in India had an impact of 2.8 times higher than the actual quality of the product. The outcomes suggest that marked price has a significant impact on consumer's behavior. The results also indicate the existence of a strong correlation between trapping fake discounts and purchase by deceiving and persuading customers in India.

The purpose of this article is to help the practicing plastic surgeon understand reviews and review websites. Methods: A review of both the medical literature and online blogs was performed to identify the most current information pertinent to plastic surgeons. Results: Negative reviews can impact a potential patient's decision on where to seek plastic surgery, and the best way to dilute that impact is to attract good reviews. Good reviews result from running an excellent practice, and patient surveys can help identify and address problems. The qualities of each of the seven online patient review websites are summarized, along with practice advice on how to attract reviews and how to deal with fake, fraudulent, and negative reviews. Conclusions: Reviews impact plastic surgeons, whether or not they are aware of what patients are saying about them online.

Using the entrepreneurial marketing (EM) perspective of “co-creation of value”, this paper aims to explore the manner in which consumers of political communications in a specific region have created user generated value via setting up Facebook forums to manage the risk created by fake news and the trust deficit between citizens and mainstream media (MSM). Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a “netnographic” approach to investigation and the data is analysed manual coding (Kozinets, 2015). Facebook groups form the virtual research field in in the context of this study. This approach is adopted because in a social media environment, netnography capitalises over a growing virtual and online communities and allows researchers to study the richness of these online communities (Mkono and Markwell, 2014). Findings: The study provides insights on how administrators and moderators of Facebook groups create value for other users by identifying and communicating the risks emerging from social media-based political communication. The study finds that such citizen-led initiatives act as online social aggregators. The value that such groups offer its users/members resides within a well-bound, controlled and moderated online medium that encourages users to counter fake news and misinformation – thereby solving a key problem within the user market i.e. citizen-media trust deficit. Research limitations/implications: The study uses a qualitative, netnographic approach and the emerging insights cannot be generalised. The emergent findings are specific to the context of this study and researchers are encouraged to further test the propositions emerging from this research in varied contexts. Practical implications: The study extends the application of EM in political contexts using the seven dimensions of EM, which will provide impetus for future political campaigns in terms of unique value creation for publics. The paper also emerges with the role citizen-initiated forums can play in the effective dissemination of digital political communication as user generated content is aiding political debate. Social implications: The study helps highlight the role Facebook forums can play in informing the political discourse within a region. The general distrust amongst the citizens over information produced by MSM has meant vocal critics have taken to Facebook to provide their subjective opinions. Although the findings of this study show that such forums can help identify “fake news” and help citizens discuss and debate the truth, it can also become an avenue to manage propaganda amongst the “unaware” citizens. This paper flags up the issues and benefits of using Facebook forums and in conclusion relates them to similar occurrences of the past to make society aware of the pitfalls of managed propaganda. Originality/value: The paper takes initiative in investigating the use of social media in politics from the citizens’ perspective, which is comparatively marginalised against the number of studies taking place, which investigate the political party end use of social media for political marketing. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Hoodia went through a period of fame turned to infamy from approximately 1997 to 2007, shrouded by secrecy over its purported weight-loss effects. While such effects were still being researched and under development, the product was overrun by marketers seizing a business opportunity to sell a purported wonder drug to ready believers. The hype about Hoodia came to a screeching halt when drug developers dropped the project and lawsuits against marketers revealed that their claims were unstubstantiated. Whereas some burned through millions of dollars on research and development only to realize that the product in the desired from did not hold its promise, others made the same millions and more touting fake claims and peddling fake products. Many factors contributed to the failure of the attempt to develop and commercialize Hoodia, but no single issue is as prominent as the fact that the products, as manufactured and intended, ultimately did not work.

To tackle this challenge, customized 2D barcode is proposed to satisfy the requirements of the enterprise anti-counterfeiting certification. Based on information hiding technology, the proposed approach can solve these challenging problems and provide a low-cost, difficult to forge, and easy to identify solution, while achieving the function of conventional 2D barcodes. By weighting between the perceptual quality and decoding robustness in sensing recognition, the customized 2D barcode can maintain a better aesthetic appearance for anti-counterfeiting and achieve fast encoding. A new picture-embedding scheme was designed to consider 2D barcode, within a unit image block as a basic encoding unit, where the 2D barcode finder patterns were embedded after encoding. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed customized barcode could provide better encoding characteristics, while maintaining better decoding robustness than several state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, as a closed source 2D barcode that could be visually anti-counterfeit, the customized 2D barcode could effectively prevent counterfeiting that replicate physical labels. Benefitting from the high-security, high information capacity, and low-cost, the proposed customized 2D barcode with sensing recognition scheme provide a highly practical, valuable in terms of marketing, and anti-counterfeiting traceable solution for future smart IoT applications. © 2020 by the authors.

On the basis of social networks conduct various research, advertising, and marketing campaigns. Increasingly, Internet opportunities are actively used to shape public opinion, which, in turn, can affect the quality of life, political processes in the country and the world. Therefore, the issue of cybersecurity of information in social networks requires special attention. One of the main problems is social bots or harmful accounts. They can play both a negative and a positive role, but most often they are a tool for reducing trust in social networks, mass theft of personal data, organizing information injections, and so on. Therefore, the ever-growing threats of using malicious accounts make the task of their effective detection especially urgent and directly related to the cybersecurity of both users and critical data. An analysis of existing methods for detecting malicious accounts showed that most of them are based on classification. Each of the methods to some extent solves the problem of dividing data into groups with the same characteristics. Therefore, there is a need to develop an effective method for detecting malicious accounts. For these purposes, a systematic analysis of clustering methods was carried out in order to select the most effective for solving the set tasks. Based on these results, it was determined that cluster analysis is the most unified tool for solving the problem of detecting bots. And to obtain the most reliable results, it was proposed to use a combination of two methods of cluster analysis - hierarchical and fuzzy. In the systems operating today, the detection of social malicious bots is carried out using strict methods and conditions. Suspicious user accounts are either blocked or subjected to additional verification, which may cause users to leave the social network or switch to another alternative social network. In the developed algorithm, at first, the system is loyal to all new accounts, and additional analytical methods are used to classify suspicious users. This allows suspicious accounts with ambiguous indicators to be subjected to additional classification after a certain period, after collecting statistics and monitoring their behavior, and only after confirming that they belong to harmful accounts, to offer verification. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors."

Recent literature has indicated that it can be a serious threat to brands and their management. Brands can be both victims of, and either unwitting or deliberate agents of fake news. This paper presents the results of a three-round Delphi study of a panel of brand marketing scholars in which they indicated their familiarity with ten major high-tech brands, and estimated the vulnerability of these to fake news, and how effectively these brands would deal with fake news. The levels of familiarity with the brands vary considerably, and it also appears that lower familiarity with the brand (with one notable exception) is associated with higher estimates of vulnerability, and lower estimates of the management’s ability to deal effectively with fake news. The researchers considered a large number of commercial media brand ratings with titles such as, “World’s Best Hi-tech Brands”, “100 Most Valuable Brands”, “25 Best Technology Brands” and the like. Not surprisingly all these lists are marked by their differences rather than their similarities. A handful of brands such as Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft feature in all these rankings, but behind them, there tend to be differences. For purposes of this study, the researchers then settled on and included the following ten high-tech brands: Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Intel, eBay, Facebook and Dell. The fake news phenomenon is unlikely to dissipate in the future, especially as social media technologies continue to make its spread so much easier. The risk to brands will be ever-present and will almost certainly increase. Hi-tech brand custodians do and will need to be vigilant of how they might be vulnerable and to have contingency plans in place for that day in the future when their brand becomes a target. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

However, not all sales promotions have only good effects, some of them will have negative influences on consumers, resulting in some consumers’ dislike to online shopping website. Based on the grounded theory, we conducted a qualitative analysis of the viewpoints of 123 consumers who dislike the double 11 shopping carnival. After coding, we found that the complex rules of promotion, fake discounts, compelling marketing, disadvantages of goods/services might have caused consumers’ aversion to shopping festival.

For each classification task, we identify and extract suitable learning features and study their relative importance. Through a prototype system termed RI.SI.CO., we show that this approach is feasible, fast, and more accurate than both existing systems for trustworthiness assessment and non-expert humans. We next introduce two complementary metrics for evaluating the counterfeit incidence in brand search results: namely, a chart-based and a single-value measure. They allow us to analyze and compare counterfeit at various levels, including single brands within a specific sector as well as whole sectors. Experimenting with two luxury goods sectors, we report a number of interesting findings about how the main search parameters (e.g., search engine, query type, number of search results seen) affect counterfeiting and how this activity changes with time.

Accumulating global evidence shows that pseudo-users are used for different purposes, such as the amplification of political topics or the simulation of large numbers of followers. Social bots, as a (semi-)automated pseudo-user type, are part of a larger infrastructure, among others, entailing network access, fake accounts, and hosting services. Users and providers of social bots and their infrastructure can differ. Thus, it is plausible that a digital goods market has emerged for the exchange of social bots and infrastructure components. The present study used an ethnographic approach to study the accessibility, availability, and prices for pseudo-users and social bots on markets in the (German- and English-language) Clearnet and Darknet. The results show that an infrastructure for digital manipulation is widely available online, and that the tools for artificial content or connectedness amplification are easily accessible for lay users and are cheap on Clearnet and Darknet markets. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."

In this type of scam, fraudsters craft fake profiles and manually interact with their victims. Because of the characteristics of this type of fraud and how dating sites operate, traditional detection methods (e.g., those used in spam filtering) are ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the archetype of online dating profiles used in this form of fraud, including their use of demographics, profile descriptions, and images, shedding light on both the strategies deployed by scammers to appeal to victims and the traits of victims themselves. Furthermore, in response to the severe financial and psychological harm caused by dating fraud, we develop a system to detect romance scammers on online dating platforms. This paper presents the first fully described system for automatically detecting this fraud. Our aim is to provide an early detection system to stop romance scammers as they create fraudulent profiles or before they engage with potential victims. Previous research has indicated that the victims of romance scams score highly on scales for idealized romantic beliefs. We combine a range of structured, unstructured, and deep-learned features that capture these beliefs in order to build a detection system. Our ensemble machine-learning approach is robust to the omission of profile details and performs at high accuracy (97%) in a hold-out validation set.

An apparent dimension of social media is the virality of information, which when generated from redundant and false user identities, may cause chaos across online social communities. Duplicate user profiles are quite conventional in social networks causing unintentional faults or intentional deceptions. Such fraudulent motives may involve cyberbullying, fake boosting, fake following, cyberstalking, etc. Hence, revealing the malicious users having multiple profiles in social networks has become significant for downstream analysis to ensure cyber safety. Identity resolution is considered one of the pivotal techniques to reveal redundant identities, which are found co-referent to the same real-world user. As per social media theory, there are different stages for automated identity resolution, namely identity searching, identity linking and identity merging. Our research is focused on developing a novel identity resolution framework for detecting redundant user profiles on Twitter social media constructed with nodes, ranging from small-scale to massive-scale networks. Our proposed solution extracts Twitter user profiles with various attributes, for instance, first name, last name, username, user id, tag line, location, language, profile URL and tweets. We developed various algorithms for matching and merging redundant user profiles with the Jaro–Winkler similarity technique. The similar profiles are linked to eradicating their distinctive impact from the originally constructed social network. Our experimental outcomes illustrate iteration-wise reduction of irrelevant and redundant profiles for the close-community of the randomly selected user, which is further extended to the entire user-based and trend-based Twitter network. The results of our approach were compared with existing counterparts and were found to excel in performance concerning accuracy in the detection of redundant identities. Our approach would greatly assist viral marketing, terrorist screening, and social media trending. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The purpose of this article is to provide a more advanced understanding of the underlying processes that contribute to the spread of health- and beauty-related rumors and of the mechanisms that can mitigate the risks associated with the diffusion of fake news. Design/methodology/approach: By adopting denialism as a conceptual lens, this article introduces a framework that aims to explain the mechanisms through which fake news and pseudo-facts propagate within the health and beauty industry. Three exemplary case studies situated within the context of the health and beauty industry reveal the persuasiveness of these principles and shed light on the diffusion of false and misleading information. Findings: The following seven denialistic marketing tactics that contribute to diffusion of fake news can be identified: (1) promoting a socially accepted image; (2) associating brands with a healthy lifestyle; (3) use of experts; (4) working with celebrity influencers; (5) selectively using and omitting facts; (6) sponsoring research and pseudo-science; and (7)exploiting regulatory loopholes. Through a better understanding of how fake news spreads, brand managers can simultaneously improve the optics that surround their firms, promote sales organically and reinforce consumers’ trust toward the brand.

Further, consumers are oftentimes acquiring news from social media sites rather than directly from trusted news sources. According to a 2017 study by the Pew Research Center, two thirds of Americans (67%) report getting at least some of their news through social media sites such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter (Shearer and Gottfried 2017). In a time when non-verified information is readily available, shared, and promoted, the need for editorial oversight and consumer judgment is greater than ever. The marketing industry is at a moral crossroads. At a time when research shows that 75% of American adults who were familiar with a fake news headline viewed the story as accurate (Silverman and Singer-Vine 2016), consumers are more likely than ever to pass along “news” that is inaccurate or even harmful. Additionally, brands are at risk. Google and Facebook are under increasing pressure to take aim at the perpetrators. The American electorate is at the epicenter of fake news, with many reports suggesting the 2016 election fell pray to online fake news sources perpetrating attacks on various political entities. And popular brands have fallen victim to fake news stories impacting revenue and customer equity. Rumors are not new. We adapt the definition of fake news based on Berthon and Pitt (2018): “fake news can take the form of fake stories, fake pictures, fake reviews, and fake polls” (page 1). In addition to the growth of fake news via increased online media, the social media generation has less media literacy than previous generations. Additionally, the internet as a media vehicle has less editorial oversight and a vast potential for virility. These developments have led us to the following research question: given such limited editorial oversight, what is it that leads consumers to believe and share, or alternatively, believe yet not share, fake news stories?

There are many issues in sentiment mining, classification, and analysis like huge lexicon, Natural language processing overhead, fake reviews, etc. Out of these issues, one major problem is that the comments and reviews can be in different languages like French, Chines, English, Urdu, Arabic, etc. To handle each language according to its syntax, semantic, and structure is a challenging task. Many researchers work on English, Urdu, and Arabic sentiment analysis, but very limited work has been done on resource constrain languages like Roman Urdu. In this paper, Python is used to execute different classification machine learning models for Roman Urdu text analysis. A total of 3000 reviews dataset has been scrapped from different hotel websites. The results show that logistic regression and SVM outperformed in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure. © 2020 IEEE."

Lot of organic shops were mushrooming not only in cities but also in towns which are nearby cities. Though there are lots of studies on organic produce consumption, studies pertaining to organic marketing are limited. This study analyzed the details of organic marketing like price fixation by organic retailers, management practices followed by them for perishables, method of farmer selection by retailers and ways used for popularizing the shop among consumers. In order to promote retailing, besides creating awareness the study also sought for controlling fake organic produce or products in markets through proper monitoring mechanism. © 2020 Plant Archives.

The nature of such sites makes identity deception easy, providing a fast means for creating and managing identities, and then connecting with and deceiving others. Fake users are those accounts specifically created for purposes such as stalking or abuse of another user, for slander, or for marketing. The current system for detecting deception depends on behavioral, non-behavioral and user-generated content (UGC) information gathered from users. Although these methods have high detection accuracy, they cannot be implemented in databases with massive volumes of data. To address this issue, this paper proposes an enhanced graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm (EGSLA) to detect fake users from a large volume of Twitter data. The proposed method encompasses four modules: data collection, feature extraction, classification and decision making. Data collected from Twitter using Scrapy is utilized for the evaluation. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested with existing game theory, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree techniques. The results show that the proposed EGSLA algorithm achieves 90.3% accuracy in spotting fake users. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Most marketing communications research focuses on the private sector. Marketing communications in the public sector are comprehensive and multi-functional. So, marketing communications in public administration are considered not only as a complex of information and communication mechanisms. They also include political, social, economic and cultural aspects. The marketing communications system should be formed both on the domestic market (provision of administrative services to the population and formation of a positive image of state power) and external (establishment of cooperation with international partners and conduct of international policy). According to statistics, the system of information support of public administration is considered relevant by more than 60% of the population of Ukraine. Therefore, given the relevance of this issue, it is useful to determine its practical significance. The establishment of a marketing communications system in public administration should provide the population with mobile provision of administrative services of high quality, the creation of systems of democratic civil society through the development of electronic petitions, the formation of a favorable image of the state to ensure high support for the processes of state creation among the population and at the international level to attract additional investments and ensure tourist attractiveness. Among the current directions of development of marketing communications of public administration are advertising, PR-technologies, image and brand construction, fight against “negative” and fake information, provision of electronic management and provision of administrative services online. However, providing the population with access to the Internet also remains an important issue, as it is this resource that is the main one for the introduction of digitization and digitalization processes in the country. © 2020 Lifescience Global."

This scenario has led the society to concerns on increase in dishonest activities and spreading of lies and their consequent contribution to polarization of views, disharmony and prejudice. The first important case surfaced with the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal and there have since been many speculations about the influence of fake-news, transmitted through social networks in several elections, such as those in USA, Brazil and Nigeria. Consequently, checking the veracity of news propagated through social networks has become indispensable, and this responsibility must be borne by the social networks firms; accordingly, they have begun developing and operating rigorous electronic verifying algorithms. This is a microscopic approach toward the fake-news problem, and can be complemented with a macroscopic approach using some compartmental models that are commonly employed in epidemiology and rumor propagation. Specifically, the Daley–Kendall (DK) model, which appears to be a realistic compartmental model in rumor spreading and viral marketing, is suitable to describe fake-news propagation and can be equipped with a veracity checking compartment of population. In this study, the DK model is adopted to address the fake-news propagation problem, and the influence of the newly included veracity checking compartment on attenuating fake news is studied. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

Uptake is currently very limited. The aims of this study were to characterize what public health professionals thought about promoting the HepE vaccine in Shanghai, China, and to develop realistic goals for the HepE vaccine based on this information. Methods: Public health professionals from Shanghai and other jurisdictions of China were contacted to participate in in-depth qualitative interviews between October 2017 and August 2018. Participants were asked about their perception of the HepE vaccine roll-out. Codes were initially based on the structure of the questionnaire. Subsequently, similar ideas were further developed into themes based on what was present in the transcript data. Results: Thirty-five individuals participated. Major topics of discussion included (1) clarifying the roles and responsibilities of private and public institutions in promoting and marketing the HepE vaccine, (2) identifying what methods of promotion were most efficient, and, (3) endeavoring to formulate a reasonable and realistic goal, if any, for HepE prevention and control in China. Participants emphasized that public sector sources can be trusted sources of information (although the private vaccination company can also be useful in disseminating information) and social media such as WeChat can be good ways to disseminate articles (although netizens may be worried about the spread of fake news). Vaccine promotion is restrained given limited levels of knowledge in the government, hospitals, and public health vaccination centers. Conclusion: Successful promotion and use of this vaccine in China, even in limited settings (for instance, certain workplaces, or certain groups) could provide additional information on long-term safety and could promote its adoption in other regions of the world where HepE has high morbidity among pregnant women and other populations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

The success or failure of a movie is determined by the box office collection. The box office collection is dependent on various factors like director, actors, actresses, technicians, production house, musicians, marketing, etc. But yet it is highly influenced by the reviews and feedbacks given by the people, critics, media, etc. Due to the latest trends in the marketing field, digital media is used as a form of recommendation system where users read the reviews about a movie, or the ratings rated before making any decision to watch a movie. The existing problem that are identified with these reviews is that nowadays bots are being deployed to increase the reviews, and also fake reviews, negative reviews are also a major concern since most of the reviews are given by people without watching the movies. These problems create huge financial loss to the company, the people associated with it and also the movie industry as a whole. So in order to overcome the existing problems we are considering using blockchain technology as the future of entertainment industry. Since blockchain is a distributed network we can use it to store the reviews given by the user which is nontamperable and this in turn can help rate a movie correctly. Because of the genuine reviews stored in blockchain, movie goers can choose the correct film and make a good film successful thereby increasing the box office collection of the movie.  © 2021 IEEE."

In blockchain technology the transactions are recorded in a node or in blocks. Recording these transactions using blockchain technology ensures the security of the transactions. Digital marketing has continued to witness more complexity. The social media marketers have been grappling how best they can validate their data. This has largely been as a result of the complexity witnessed in social media marketing. For years now, social media marketers have relied on third-party tools to conduct validation of the data. The delivery of e-governance services need much more validation, security, trust and reliability. One of the effects of blockchain on social media is the opportunity to validate own data. The enhanced ability to share content via social media has generated opportunity for governments to enhance functionalities and analysis of delivered services. The immutability and trust characteristics of Blockchain technology enables government to stop unauthorized access of services. This finality factor ensures nobody has an authority to make any changes in the system. This can verify the authenticity of services along with protect spread of fake systems and services.

This study aims at identifying the behavioral and neural correlates of Consumer Ethnocentrism in the field of brand preference, using event-related potential (ERP). We sampled subjects from two ethnic groups, a Chinese ethnic group and a sub-Saharan Black African group from Zhejiang University. The subjects faced two sequential stimuli, S1 followed by S2. S1 consisted of 40 pictures of 20 Chinese and 20 Black Africans people wearing traditional clothes, and S2 consisted of 40 fake brand-logos which were divided randomly into two groups of 20 each. The subjects were informed that the people in S1 purchased and recommended the products with the brand-logos presented in S2, and the subjects were asked to rate their preference degree toward these logos. The brand-logos were called the “in-group recommended logos” if the recommenders in S1 were the same race as the subjects, otherwise, the “out-group recommended logos.” The results revealed that the race of the brand-logo recommender highly impacted the Chinese subjects’ preference for the brand-logos. The N200 component elicited by the in-group recommended logos were significantly lower than those elicited by the out-group recommended logos. Additionally, there was evidence that being familiar with foreign cultures reduced consumer ethnocentrism. The African subjects were familiar with Chinese people and adopted a Chinese culture, as a result, they did not differ in showing preferences between the in-group and out-group recommended logos. © 2019 Ma, Abdeljelil and Hu."

Design/methodology/approach: A Delphi study of 42 academics with peer-reviewed publications in the brand management domain. Findings: The study found that on some dimensions (e.g. the culpability of brand managers for incentivizing fake news by sponsoring its sources), expert opinion varied greatly. Other dimensions (e.g. whether the impact of fake news on brand management is increasing) reached a high level of consensus. The general findings indicate that fake news is an increasing phenomenon.

A celebrity’s direct (vs averted) eye gaze can be used as a tactic in social media posts to increase self-celebrity connection and behavioral intentions. Examining the effectiveness of a celebrity’s eye gaze is important, as celebrities regularly use social media to manage their brand image and to build a relationship with consumers. Design/methodology/approach: Study 1 examines the effect of a celebrity’s eye gaze (direct vs averted) on self-celebrity connection. Study 2 investigates the role of celebrity authenticity in explaining the effect of a celebrity’s eye gaze on consumer–celebrity brand relationships. Study 3 examines the moderating role of a non-Duchenne smile (fake, social smile) in diluting the effect of a celebrity’s direct eye gaze on self-celebrity connection and the downstream consequences on behavioral intentions. Findings: The findings from Study 1 indicate that a celebrity’s direct (averted) eye gaze strengthens (weakens) self-celebrity connection. Study 2 provides evidence of celebrity authenticity as the explanation for stronger consumer–celebrity connection when a celebrity is featured with a direct eye gaze. The results of Study 3 show that a fake smile in a celebrity’s social media posts can weaken relationships with and behavioral intentions toward celebrities with a direct eye gaze. Research limitations/implications: This paper is limited, as it focuses only on eye gaze and smiles as non-verbal cues depicted in celebrity images on social media. Practical implications: This paper has important implications for celebrities, celebrity brand managers (including digital/social media marketing managers and public relations professionals) and advertisers. Celebrities, celebrity brand managers and advertisers should develop social media posts that can strengthen consumer–celebrity relationships and positively influence behaviors toward the celebrity through: 1) ensuring that photographs are taken with the celebrity looking directly into the camera at the target (audience); and 2) avoiding posting images of a celebrity’s direct eye gaze with a non-Duchenne (fake) smile. Originality/value: This paper introduces and provides evidence of a celebrity’s direct eye gaze–self-celebrity relationship effect.

Predominantly, social media are used as the best marketing proposal, as it can reach a huge audience with low cost. Social media consists of communication websites that aids in establishing a relationship between users from various backgrounds, ensuring a rich social organization. Social media is also helping to fuel the global economy by creating new jobs, democratizing information and pushing brands far beyond their borders. Findings: “Information systems are the combinations of hardware, software, and telecommunications systems that people construct and use to gather, create, and allocate useful data, characters in an organizational background”. An information System that supports the sharing of content among the networks of the users is termed as Social Media Information System (SMIS). Regrettably, some people utilize Social media to deleteriously target people via scams or by adjusting accounts on Facebook, through email or counterfeit websites. This makes social media a profitable and attractive objective for criminals and people with a mischief motive. One of the most efficient methods is creating a fake account.

It argues that, while these types of automated tactics are met with resistance in current research, they can aid effective non-profit marketing strategy. The critiques levelled at these tactics are twofold: programmatic advertising causes loss of organic discovery of information (or loss of serendipity), and programmatic ads delivered to specific target audiences can be used to spread fake news and influence decision-making. The Cambridge Analytica scandal is perhaps the best example of how these tactics can be used unethically to manipulate behaviour. The paper critically engages with these critiques and argues that, when used effectively, programmatic advertising and micro-targeting can drive more effective results and advance non-profit and voluntary-sector marketing. Building upon human information behaviour, the paper produces a model to unpack the logics behind these strategies and identify best practices for use in nonprofit marketing. The model is tested by distributing a digital serious game and an evaluative questionnaire, which has been designed in collaboration with multiple third-sector stakeholders to raise awareness about economic abuse and inform about available support in Scotland. The results demonstrate that the model accurately and effectively reflects users' behaviours when exposed to programmatically delivered messages. Given these outcomes, the paper proposes that programmatic advertising and micro-targeting offer new opportunities for the third sector. This is not to mean that concerns do not exist; rather, to maximise marketing efforts within a third sector and ethically focused context, a strong understanding of content and the algorithmic logics of programmatic distribution is needed. This paper aims to contribute new perspectives on programmatic advertising and micro-targeting and enrich literature and theoretical corpus on these topics in the context of nonprofit and institutional marketing. © 8th European Conference on Social Media, ECSM 2021."

As personality–job fit theory claims, employees must have suitable personality traits for particular IS professions. However, candidates can try to fake-good on personality tests towards the desired personality type. Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify archetypal IS professions, their associated personality types and examine the reliability of the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality test in IS recruitment decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors reviewed academic literature related to IS professions to identify job archetypes and personality traits for IS professions. Then, the authors conducted an experiment with 452 participants to investigate whether candidates can fake-good on personality tests when being tested for a particular IS profession. Findings: The identified job archetypes were IS project manager, IS marketing specialist, IS consultant, IS security specialist, data scientist and business process analyst. The experimental results show that the participants were not able to fake-good considerably regarding their personality traits for a particular archetype. Research limitations/implications: The taxonomy of IS professions should be validated further. The experiment was executed in an educational organisation and not in a real-life environment.

Through the systematic review of the related studies and support through relevant literature, the findings of the research include various harmful impacts of the notion. This ranges from small impacts such as spread of misinformation to more sinister impacts such as the wrongful utilisation of drugs for curing the disease. Moreover, the paper also mentions the various motives behind the spread of such false information, primarily fuelled by collecting monetary benefits in terms of digital marketing, etc. Overall, the study concludes the impacts of spread of fake news and myths are generally harmful to the public at large.

Previous research has shown that introductory scarcity has a positive effect on consumers' willingness to pay, but this effect has yet to be quantified. This paper investigates how scarcity strategies affect product pricing and a firm's profits. We consider two types of scarcity strategies, a real and a fake scarcity strategy, and propose a two-period model in both markdown and markup scenarios. We find that an introductory scarcity strategy is profitable in a markup scenario only if the discount factor is greater than a critical value and payoffs are compartmentalized. Moreover, an introductory scarcity strategy could result in profits in a markdown scenario if consumers are sensitive to scarcity. However, a scarcity strategy is always detrimental to a firm with low-quality products in both scenarios. If there are uninformed consumers in the market, a fake scarcity strategy is beneficial for firms in the short term but not in the long term. © 2019 The Authors.

Researchers, policymakers and practitioners are eagerly searching for solutions to get us out of the “fake news crisis”. Here, one approach is to use automated tools, such as artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, to support managers in identifying fake news. The study in this paper demonstrates how AI with its ability to analyze vast amounts of unstructured data, can help us tell apart fake and real news content. Using an AI application, this study examines if and how the emotional appeal, i.e., sentiment valence and strength of specific emotions, in fake news content differs from that in real news content. This is important to understand, as messages with a strong emotional appeal can influence how content is consumed, processed and shared by consumers. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzes a data set of 150 real and fake news articles using an AI application, to test for differences in the emotional appeal in the titles and the text body between fake news and real news content. Findings: The results suggest that titles are a strong differentiator on emotions between fake and real news and that fake news titles are substantially more negative than real news titles. In addition, the results reveal that the text body of fake news is substantially higher in displaying specific negative emotions, such as disgust and anger, and lower in displaying positive emotions, such as joy. Originality/value: This is the first empirical study that examines the emotional appeal of fake and real news content with respect to the prevalence and strength of specific emotion dimensions, thus adding to the literature on fake news identification and marketing communications. In addition, this paper provides marketing communications professionals with a practical approach to identify fake news using AI. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In this model, a social network is represented by a graph G whose vertices have different labels corresponding to the type of role the person plays in the network (e.g. a student, an educator etc.). Once an initial set of vertices of G is randomly selected to be carrying a gossip (e.g. to be infected), the gossip propagates to a new vertex provided it is transmitted by a minimum threshold of vertices with different labels. By considering random graphs, which have been shown to closely represent social networks, we study different properties of the T-BP model through numerical simulations, and describe its implications when applied to rumour spread, fake news and marketing strategies. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society."

The solution to this problem pertains to influence maximization algorithms that identify the right nodes to lockdown for epidemic containment, hire for viral marketing campaigns, block for online political propaganda etc. Though these algorithms have been developed for many years, the majority of the literature focuses on scalability issues and relaxing the method’s assumptions. In the recent years, the emergence of new complementary data and more advanced machine learning methods for decision have guided part of the literature towards learning-based approaches. These can range from learning how information spreads over a network, to learning how to solve the combinatorial optimization problem itself. In this tutorial, we aim to dissentangle and clearly define the different tasks around learning for influence applications in social networks. More specifically, we start from traditional influence maximization algorithms, describe the need of influence estimation and delineate the state-of-the-art on influence and diffusion learning.

Considering the “improvement” of fraudulent skills, scientists, editors, and authorities must jointly combat the misconduct. Also, it is important that whistleblowers must be protected from revenge. The response to scientific misconduct requires national and international bodies to provide leadership and guidelines. Whistleblowers need a safe, confidential place to report misconduct. The quality of research and hidden conflicts of interest should be taken into account deciding which studies are to be included into reviews. Forged publications and speculative theories have been used for promotion of drugs, dietary supplements and treatments without proven effectiveness. Marketing of placebos in the guise of evidence-based medications seems to be on the increase. Patients can be misinformed not only by the advertising but also by publications supposed to be scientific. Furthermore, it has become usual practice to disregard published criticism in spite of personal communications and debates at conferences. Some scientists seem to make use of critical comments without citing them, or just continue publications ignoring the criticism. The same scientists continue working sometimes in cooperation with renowned researchers; and it is possible that some later articles are more reliable than earlier ones. However, it is insufficient to hope that reliable publications would be shortly confirmed while forgeries would fall into oblivion. Fake papers are misleading for research and practice, cost time and money. Wrong concepts are persisting and reappearing, which may result in useless experimentation and application of invasive methods without sufficient indications.

To design better web literacy practices for assessing online information, we need to understand how people perceive the credibility of unfamiliar websites under time constraints. Would they be able to rate real news websites as more credible and fake news websites as less credible? We investigated this research question through an experimental study with 42 participants (mean age = 28.3) who were asked to rate the credibility of various “real news” (n = 14) and “fake news” (n = 14) websites under different time conditions (6s, 12s, 20s), and with a different advertising treatment (with or without ads). Participants did not visit the websites to make their credibility assessments; instead, they interacted with the images of website screen captures, which were modified to remove any mention of website names, to avoid the effect of name recognition. Participants rated the credibility of each website on a scale from 1 to 7 and in follow-up interviews provided justifications for their credibility scores. Through hypothesis testing, we find that participants, despite limited time exposure to each website (between 6 and 20 seconds), are quite good at the task of distinguishing between real and fake news websites, with real news websites being overall rated as more credible than fake news websites. Our results agree with the well-known theory of “first impressions” from psychology, that has established the human ability to infer character traits from faces. That is, participants can quickly infer meaningful visual and content cues from a website, that are helping them make the right credibility evaluation decision. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Usage of Internet and specifically social media platforms for promoting businesses and services has seen a drastic increase in the recent times. Influencer-based marketing is a major area for promotion. With its major dominance, comes its downsides. This influencer-based model alternatively being referred to as influencer marketing has a major drawback which concerns one of the foremost aspects of digital media, organic and inorganic results. Many of the social media platforms involve inorganic audience which includes fake popularity for the concerned account. This heavily impacts the advertisements business being run on social media and other platforms. This could lead to wrong audience impact involving losses for the business as well as the customers being targeted. In this study, a trust-based model is designed in which the social media platform, Instagram, is checked for fake audience involvement and their consecutive detection for better future impressions. For the detection of inorganic audience involvement, firstly, a study is done regarding the parameters that could assist the detection process. These parameters are further used to generate the nodes of a decision tree. Second of all, the dataset is prepared for the detection process. Machine learning is used to make the predictions on the dataset as with minimum human intervention, it can help automate the entire process and make it much faster than manual detection. Decision tree is then applied to the dataset for building a prediction based model, which is used to predict the occurrence of fake accounts in test dataset.

This echoing further boosts the spread to regions substantially larger than the initial region. These spreading accounts can be actual humans or social bots. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reveals an interesting anomaly in information cascades in Twitter and proposes the spreading group model that explains this anomaly. The model was tested using an agent-based simulation, real Twitter data and questionnaires. Findings: The messages of few anonymous Twitter accounts spread on average more than well-known global financial media groups, such as The Wall Street Journal or Bloomberg. The spreading groups (also sometimes called BotNets) model provides an effective mechanism that can explain these findings. Research limitations/implications: Spreading groups are only one possible mechanism that can explain the effectiveness of spread of tweets from lesser known accounts. The implication of this work is in showing how spreading groups can be used as a mechanism to spread messages in social networks. The construction of spreading groups is rather technical and does not require using opinion leaders. Similar to the case of “Fake News,” we expect the topic of spreading groups and their aim to manipulate information to receive growing attention in public discussion. Practical implications: While harnessing opinion leaders to spread messages is costly, constructing spreading groups is more technical and replicable. Spreading groups are an efficient method to amplify the spread of message in social networks. Social implications: With the blossoming of fake news, one might tend to assess the reliability of news by the number of users involved in its spread. This heuristic might be easily fooled by spreading groups. Furthermore, spreading groups consisting of a blend of human and computerized bots might be hard to detect. They can be used to manipulate financial markets or political campaigns. Originality/value: The paper demonstrates an anomaly in Twitter that was not studied before. It proposes a novel approach to spreading messages in social networks. The methods presented in the paper are valuable for anyone interested in spreading messages or an agenda such as political actors or other agenda enthusiasts.

The social media platforms such as Whatsapp, iMessage, Signal, Wire, Threema, etc., follow end-to-end encryption for security. A problem occurs when metadata is exchanged along with messages, thereby providing an opportunity for third parties to steal the user’s personal details. Blockchain-based social media provide more benefits than just security and privacy: Cryptocurrencies are used for secure communication by paying and buying content in peer-to-peer marketing. Blockchain assists in gaining control over the user’s own content. A decentralized approach to blockchain technology in social networking ensures privacy and enables e-commerce, crowdfunding transactions as well as smart apps and contracts. Nowadays, the digital social network media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, etc., provide free access. Obviously, development and server infrastructures are vital to social networking platforms and their profit focuses on advertising and analytics in the social network business era. The fundamental problems facing social networking includes fake news (Facebook), excessive trolling (Twitter), censorship and demonetization (YouTube). © 2020 Scrivener Publishing LLC."

Additionally, it also measured the effects on attitudes towards purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: The scope of the study is the Chinese market. The sample size for the study was 412 participants, and data were collected through established scales and measures. Structural equation modelling was used to test the developed model. Findings: All the developed hypotheses were accepted. All the antecedents negatively affect attitudes towards counterfeit luxury products. At the same time, attitude has a positive effect on purchase intention. The results are consistent with those of earlier studies. Research limitations/implications: Samples were gathered from just a single region in southwest China, which limits the generalisability of the discoveries. As past research in fake goods buying has done, future investigations relating to this situation in the domain of ethical reasoning should accumulate samples from other regions of China as well, as customer perception relating to profound morality and counterfeit Purchase Intention may change from region to region. Practical implications: A few customers hold the opinion that luxury brands are lucrative because of the excessive costs of their products and therefore feel vindicated in buying counterfeits (Penz and Stottinger, 2005). Combatting this conviction requires luxury brand managers to endorse effective moral ideals and social commitment messages to prevail upon purchasers. Social implications: A few customers trust that they are helping local people, such as the peddlers who offer the fakes or the producers who make these goods, suggesting in a way that a few individuals have positive attitudes towards these type of counterfeit goods sold locally. For such customers, there can be marketing messages that can show them the other side of the issue, such as the lost sales and loss caused to the organisations, which result in people becoming jobless because of their actions. Originality/value: The primary goal of the study is to explore the relationship between the moral measurements of consumers and their attitudes and purchase intentions in the Chinese market. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The authors argue that science fiction is today often mobilized as a tool for imagining a future that is incommensurable with the current late capitalist order. However, when trying to imagine a post-capitalist future, contemporary left-wing philosophers tend to look to the past for inspiration, a maneuver which only exacerbates the “exhaustion of the future,” that has retrofuturism as its cultural correlate. Based on this, the authors suggest that philosophical instrumentalization of science fiction may result in a distinct form of intellectual escapism. The article argues that in this context, special attention should be paid to the concept of hyperstition, which has arisen under the influence of science fiction narratives and is embedded in current popular rhetoric about hacking the future. The authors point out that the way hyperstition functions has a resemblance to marketing mechanisms, and they suggest that it corresponds to what Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari called an unconscious representation or fake image. The article subjects hyperstition to a critical analysis in which the authors show that the genealogy of hyperstition as a practice of programming reality through fictions stems from the ideas of William S. Burroughs. Burroughs set out to develop new ways of linguistic infection and modeling human behavior by means of his cutup technique. This approach blurs the distinction between reality and fiction. Some members of the CCRU transplanted Burroughs’ ideas to the theoretical soil that Deleuze and Guattari had tilled. Hyperstition has been reborn in the CCRU’s legacy project of left-wing accelerationism, which redirects the idea of self-fulfilling fiction toward developing a non-deterministic concept of progress. Pointing to the ineffectiveness of hyperstition as a tool for socio-political change, the authors propose abandoning Anti-Oedipus in favor of Anti-Hype. © 2020, Gaidar Institute Press.

The barriers to entry in the media industry have dropped drastically, making the scale of the problem grow exponentially. Furthermore, social media are conducive places for spreading fake news since information is not fact checked and verified and can easily be shared to millions of followers. This study investigated the moderating role of fake news in a social media context on the relationship between customer-based brand equity and consumer responses to premium brands. Fake news stories targeted at brands can negatively affect consumer’s perception of these brands and facilitate or impede consumers’ behaviour towards these brands. Since the growing middle class in South Africa often use premium brands as a form of creating self-identity and associating with an aspirational class by conspicuously consuming brands, this study tested whether the effect of fake news serves as a moderator between the brand equity of aspirational (premium) brands and these consumers’ response to these brands. A descriptive quantitative study was conducted using a convenience sample of 192 respondents. The upper middle class were chosen as respondents for this study as a result of their ability to afford premium brands and their increased tendency to consume premium brands, especially luxury vehicles, conspicuously in order to show their new wealth. Results indicated that brand awareness, brand image, perceived quality and brand associations are all good predictors of consumer response in the form of brand loyalty, willingness to pay a premium and brand preference. However, fake news in this case was not found to moderate the relationship between brand equity and consumer response. Marketing managers will do well to spend marketing budgets on developing strong brand equity. The results indicate that brand equity serves as a shield to defend brands against fake news and to minimise damage caused by fake news. Since premium brands are particularly vulnerable to fake news due to the status and self-identity consumers are able to convey through the display of these brands, managers of premium brands in particular should focus their energies on creating strong and consistent brand equity as a means of buffering the effect of fake news which is not in their control. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

Fake accounts are harmful to both users and service providers, and thus recognizing and filtering out such content on social media is essential. This study presents a new approach to detect fake Twitter accounts using ontology and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules.

In this study, we use China as an example to explore the determinants of NPAD within the framework of its health system from a socio-ecological perspective. A mixed-method combining the simulated client method (SCM) and key informant interviews conducted in Zhejiang, Hubei, and Sichuan provinces was adopted. 73.3% of the SCM interactions engendered NPAD (91.7% through antibiotic requests vs. 55% through consultation) in Chinese community pharmacies; a much higher rate than the global average. At the intrapersonal level, NPAD was found to be driven by profits from selling non-prescription antibiotics and traditional Chinese medicine. At the interpersonal level, NPAD was driven by fierce competition in the community pharmacy market and by customers' unreasonable expectations. At the institutional level, it is easy for community pharmacies to evade the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) supervision by obtaining unsupervised and fake prescriptions, refusing to give customers sale receipts, and hiding their antibiotic supplies and sale records. At the policy level, the low cost of violating the prescription-only antibiotic sale regulation and poor FDA supervision facilitated NPAD. The Chinese health system has thus failed to establish and regulate a diverse network of pharmacies for patients to fill their prescriptions; few antibiotic prescriptions are transferred from hospitals to community pharmacies. Education campaigns to increase awareness about the risks of self-medication with antibiotics among the general public, recognizable standardize prescriptions for customers to fill their prescriptions in community pharmacies, regulations on Internet and private clinic doctors' antibiotic prescribing behaviors, electronic tracking and tracing system to purchases and sales data of antibiotics and other prescription drugs, increasing cost of violating the prescription-only regulations for antibiotics sales are expected interventions to reduce NPAD. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

As a consequence, to deter counterfeiting authorities fine anyone producing or trading (in) fake goods. Yet, consuming counterfeit products is not prosecuted in certain countries, like the US or the UK, whereas it is in France or Italy. Why is it so? To tackle this issue we study how the entry of a counterfeiter affects the legal firm’s pricing and advertising strategies and profits when there is no public nor private enforcement of property rights. The rationale for focusing on price and advertising is in fact straightforward. First, it is probably the high margin, that is, the difference between the price and the (comparatively very low) production cost that makes counterfeiting financially attractive. Second, the high willingness-to-pay by consumers is driven by the brand image or reputation, and this asset is notably built through advertising. Third, public enforcement of property rights is often lax or imperfect and not all legal firms can afford private enforcement policies. Our results are as follows: First, we obtain that counterfeiting affects negatively pricing and advertising strategies before and after entry occurs. Thus counterfeiting never stimulates the building of brand reputation. Second, we show that while counterfeiting always reduces the profits of the owner of the genuine product, there are circumstances under which consumers benefit from this illegal trade (in this case the decrease in the price of the genuine good compensates the decrease in the brand reputation of this good). Such a result can rationalize the observation that fining producing and trading in fake goods can go in pairs with non-fining consumers of fake products. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The purpose of this paper is to explore the complicated relationship brands have with fake news and discuss the implications for brand management of a post-truth world. We explore the complicated relationship brands have with fake news: Brands both fuel fake news and are burned by it. Next, we turn to the intellectual and instrumental roots of the post-truth world: postmodernism and its technological enablers, show how marketing became a purveyor of the postmodern worldview, and how brands have increasingly adopted truthiness and post-fact positions.

Across the broader field of branding, ‘authenticity’ has become key to a product’s marketing. However, much of the language used to describe and market food is very difficult to define or stand-ardize – terms such as ‘local’, ‘quality’, ‘authentic’ and ‘premium’ remain confus-ing for the customer. Furthermore, in the context of branding and marketing, multiple genres of authenticity have been defined. Therefore, the food and design industries can use this lack of clarity to their advantage, emphasizing and embel-lishing some aspects of a product, and perhaps even deliberately omitting others. In doing so, they develop the narrative that will best connect with their audience. In this sense, the ‘authenticity’ of the brand or product is interpreted through this interaction and can be framed as a social construction. These issues are discussed in the context of a short UK-based case study focusing on the supermarket Tesco’s ‘fake farm’ brands that utilize the design and branding of the packaging to evoke specific aspects of ‘authenticity’. The visual material is analysed using a social semiotic approach enabling a discussion of issues relating to the communication of ‘authenticity’ in the practice of graphic design and branding, and the marketing of food with a story. © 2017 Intellect Ltd Article.

In the political realm, the use of psychometrics appears to have been used to spread both information and misinformation through social media in recent elections in the U.S. and Europe, partially resulting in the current, public debate about ‘fake news’. This paper questions the ethics of these methods, both in a commercial context and in the context of democratic processes. The ethical approach is based on the theoretical, contractarian work of John Rawls which serves as a lens through which the author examines whether the rights of citizens, as Rawls attributes them, are violated by this practice. The paper concludes that within a Rawlsian framework, use of psychometrics in commercial advertising on social media platforms is not necessarily unethical, since the user enters freely into a contract that allows for psychometrics to be used, and because this type of advertising is not necessary for full participation in society. The opposite is the case for political information, and thus, the paper concludes that use of psychometrics in political campaigning violates several of Rawls’ ethical maxims. © 2018 IEEE Computer Society.

To understand how social media-based information, misinformation, and disinformation work in practice, it is critical to identify factors that can predict social media users’ online information behavior. To this end, we designed an experiment to study the influence of the independent variables, demographics, and human values, on the dependent variables, social media users’ observed trust behavior, self-reported trust behavior, and information behavior. We report the statistically significant results of these comparisons; for example, we found that liberals were more likely to trust mainstream media (p < 0.05) and scientific journals (p < 0.05) and to state that the content of the linked pages influenced their trust (p < 0.01) than moderates; for values, we found that participants who more highly valued security were more likely to trust mainstream media articles (p < 0.05), to notice the presence or absence of hyperlinks, and to click on fake news articles (p < 0.05). Ultimately, both demographics and values can be used to predict online trust and information behavior; while demographics are commonly captured or predicted in online marketing, values represent a much less tapped opportunity to predict social media users’ online trust and information behavior. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The authors highlight that advertising and fake news appear to be locked in a growth cycle driven by financial incentives. Most concerning for brands is that, because online programmatic advertising has required advertisers to cede control over where their advertisements are displayed, many brands inevitably will find their advertisements on fake-news websites alongside controversial and inflammatory content. Beyond the ethical dilemma for brands is the potential loss of credibility.

Building on consumers’ familiarity with foods, ingredients, and cooking techniques, these replicas visually evoke other senses–taste, scent, texture, and mouthfeel–instantly providing massive amounts of information. As a ubiquitous visual marketing tool, sanpuru have contributed to the creation and maintenance of Japan’s hybrid national culinary culture, especially the pervasive ‘middlebrow’ echelon of mainstream, everyday consumer culture.

So, with the adoption of the Federal law of 31 December, 2014 No. 532-FL to the criminal code of the Russian Federation (further -The Criminal code) was amended a number of articles regulating the circulation of medicines and medical products on the pharmaceutical market, including criminal liability for illegal production of drugs and medical products (article 235.1 of the criminal code), handling of counterfeit, substandard and unregistered medicines, medical devices and circulation of falsified biologically active additives (article 238.1 of the criminal code) and counterfeiting of medicines or medical devices or the packaging of medicinal products or medical devices (article 327.2 of the criminal code). The article describes the structure of the article 238.1 of the criminal code of the Russian Federation and the bringing to criminal liability for sales of falsified, low-grade and unregistered medicines, medical devices and biologically active additive. Noting positive changes in the criminal policy of abuse in the pharmaceutical market. The author concludes that the analyzed novel of the criminal law does not yet fully meet international standards and need of the legal and technical improvements."

To increase one's social worth, people try to use this market by artificially increasing the likes on their posts. There is a lack of research in the current literature on Instagram which is one of the growing OSNs.

This places a significant strain on Advertisers who have no effective means of differentiating fabricated Ad-Reports from those which correspond to real consumer activity. To address this problem, we contribute an advert reporting system which utilizes opportunistic networking and a blockchain-inspired construction in order to identify authentic Ad-Reports by determining whether they were composed by honest or dishonest users. What constitutes a user's honesty for our system is the manner in which they access adverts on their mobile device. Dishonest users submit multiple reports over a short period of time while honest users behave as consumers who view adverts at a balanced pace while engaging in typical social activities such as purchasing goods online, moving through space and interacting with other users. We argue that it is hard for dishonest users to fake honest behaviour and we exploit the behavioural patterns of users in order to classify Ad-Reports as real or fabricated. By determining the honesty of the user who submitted a particular report, our system offers a more secure reward-claiming model which protects against fraud while still preserving the user's anonymity. © 2017 by the authors."

The numerous studies have emphasized the growing importance of e-WOM for the consumer decision-making process, particularly in the tourist sector. There are various factors that will influence the adoption of e-WOM by the users but among all these factors, credibility is of paramount importance. Changes in the platform, new consumer trends, and possible fake information require a continuous update and analysis of the factors that can influence the e-WOM perceived credibility and e-WOM adoption on TripAdvisor and other social tourism platforms. In the present study, we analyzed the following five factors that can impact e-WOM perceived credibility and e-WOM adoption: 1) volume of e-WOM; 2) source credibility; 3) rate extremism; 4) consumer involvement, and; 5) perceived e-WOM credibility. For the analysis, the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and PLS-SEM were used. The sample consisted of a total of 221 participants who responded to the questionnaire. The results revealed that, with the exception rate extremism, the four remaining factors have a significant impact on e-WOM perceived credibility and adoption.

However, there is a dearth of research that linked ethical aspects with such kind of product purchase intention. Considering this gap, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the direct as well as indirect effect of ethical aspects on the attitude of consumers’ counterfeit product purchase in the Malaysian market. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 737 questionnaires were distributed in China Town, Low Yat Plaza, as well as a few “pasar malam” (night markets), which yielded 400 completed usable responses. Partial Least Square Smart PLS software and SPSS were utilised in order to analyse the data. Findings: The results revealed that the ethical aspect in term of religiosity, ethical concern, and perception of lawfulness directly and indirectly affect consumers’ behavioural intention to purchase counterfeit products. Practical implications: It is expected that the study findings will enhance the understanding of marketers as well as policymakers about consumers’ purchase intention of such fake products. Eventually, it will help them to come up with better marketing strategies to purchase counterfeit products and to encourage them to purchase the original product. Originality/value: This is relatively a pioneer study that examines the effect of ethical aspects of consumers in term of their religiosity, ethical concern, and perception of lawfulness on their attitude towards buying counterfeit products. Additionally, this study examines the mediating role of consumer attitude to purchase counterfeit product between ethical aspects and behavioural intention, which is comparatively new to the existing body of knowledge. Last, but not the least, this research has examined these relationships in a new research context i.e., Malaysian market, which can advance the knowledge about consumer behaviour in the East Asian context. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

Key technical steps in the Dalmatian prosciutto production are salting, ham pressing, smoking and drying, ripening and finally packaging and marketing. The value chain of Dalmatian prosciutto consists of animal feed producers, breeders and slaughterhouses at upstream level, prosciutto producers at processing level and retailers at downstream level. Most of the fresh ham for Dalmatian prosciutto production is imported from Hungary and Austria. Stakeholders from upstream level are therefore outside Croatia. Downstream level is related to supermarkets, HoReCa (hotels and restaurants), specialized stores and others. Traceability is one of the major reasons which drove producers to seek a PGI denomination for this type of ham. In fact, it is now possible to remove “fake dalmatian prosciutto” from the market, as technical specifications and strong producer control prevents fraudulent use of the name Dalmatian prosciutto.Dalmatian prosciutto tends to perform better than its non-PGI reference on economic and social aspects: It sells at a higher price, generates higher economic spillover, more employment and attracts a higher share of young workers. The PGI is however outperformed on environmental aspects: It travels more, as the meat is imported and it is drier and therefore requires more raw meat per ton of finished product. It also generates slightly more water pollution by nitrates. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019."

New advertising and persuasion mechanisms have been created to undermine the reliability of traditional mass media communication that are familiar to the general audience. Consequently, 'fake news' and 'alternative facts' have emerged along with the notion of 'post-truth', which defines the state of affairs represented in public opinion that has been contaminated by these strategies.

But marketing and advertising also strangely undermine their form of mimicry, deceiving both the intended targets and the signaler simultaneously.

Mood can be reasonably hypothesized as one of the factor that influences customers' decision in buying the products or services offered. There have been many researchers reporting the correlation between moods and buying decision. However, to date, there is no such method that can exactly quantify the customer's mood. Typically, a questionnaire is given to the participant to gauge their mood on the focused product or services. The drawback from such approach is that participants can fake, exaggerate or suppress their mood resulting to questionable inference. Hence, a new method of data acquisition is needed to be able to visualize the dynamics of the customers' mood for more accurate analysis. In this paper, the customer brain signal is captured using electroencephalogram (EEG) to track and record brain wave patterns in regard to their emotional states. The sequence of emotion is then used to identify their mood. A computational visualization technique is adopted to facilitate understanding of one minute emotion transition that assembling mood. The experimental results show that such approach is feasible and can be extended to study mood in a more comprehensive manner. It is envisaged that this work will be the catalyst for large mood data analysis tool that can help researchers in the near future to look at mood and buying decision for the improvement of comprehensive customer understanding in a more accurate manner. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

Only 1%–30% of patients in need of treatment may get it. In recent years, the availability of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) has been an important advancement in treating HCV infection. However, due to cost, it is not possible to receive these drugs in many countries where infection is endemic. In these low- and middle-income countries, the main barriers to controlling HCV infection are lack of knowledge about the infection, constraints on diagnostic testing and treatment, and lack of experts. Both national and international support are essential to overcoming these barriers. In low- and middle-income countries, interferon and ribavirin-based therapies still are the first choices due to their availability and to government payment support. In addition, in developed countries, efforts to provide lower-cost DAA drugs continue. Pharmaceutical companies continue to research manufacture of bio-equivalent drugs to reduce treatment costs. Considering the fake drug market, all developments need to be monitored closely by the institutions involved. This review focuses on barriers to hepatitis C treatment and ways to overcome those barriers. © 2016 Yilmaz et al."

Particularly, in recent years, the rapid development of modern digital media technology has brought huge opportunities to the Internet digital advertising (IDA), where many digital advertising media systems have been introduced. However, after these digital advertising media systems are released to the IDA market, some problems become increasingly prominent. For example, a large number of low-quality advertisements (ADs) have caused great troubles for Internet users, and the fake traffic has plunged the IDA market into a crisis of trust. It is necessary to rebuild the trust and suppress the spreading of low-quality ADs. To address this issue, we propose a blockchain-based digital advertising media system (BDAM). With the desirable features of blockchain such as decentralization, trust system, high autonomy and tamper resistance, our system is able to improve the experience of Internet users, purify the environment of IDA market, and further promote the sound development of the IDA market. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering."

Social media have become prominent communication media, covering socializing messages, marketing messages and news messages. New messages include both ""legitimate"" news and fake news. Fake news has gained significant prominence recently. The spread of fake news has been attributed particularly to social media with the latter's role in the process receiving considerable attention because of the hugely damaging impact fake news can have. Even the World Economic Forum's 2018 meetings in Davos, have focused on fake news, the process of communicating it via social media, and the role of social media in addressing/halting the dissemination of fake news. In terms of communication theory components and this issue, while the source/the sender, the message, and the communications medium have all come under the magnifying glass, very little attention has been paid to the receiver who, after all, is the target of the fake news message. Without the receipt and ""consumption"" of, or willing belief in, the fake news by the receiver, the fake news is rendered powerless. What is it then, within the receiver, that makes them either willing or unwilling recipients of fake news? To address this question, I examine the role of the receiver in the dissemination of fake news. A literature review was undertaken to explore the nature of fake news, and our, the receiver's, understanding of the concept. The various types of social media and the suitability of some more than others, for the dissemination of fake news, are unpacked; and the relationship of the receiver with social media, the receiver's motivation to engage with social media, their attitudes, their biases, their engagement behavior and the influence of their reference groups are explored. Finally, a model is proposed which depicts the pivotal role of the receiver in the communication of fake news via social media, and the factors that influence the receiver.

Circulation figures have dropped and profits have decreased. The influence of the Internet and news online could have a significant impact on the manner in which newspaper publishers generate revenue and profits in the future. If the current decrease in circulation continues, there could be as little as 750 000 newspapers in circulation in South Africa by the year 2020. The latest figures still confirm the decline in all classes of newspapers: daily newspapers, pdf replicas, weekly newspapers, weekend and free newspapers. The study shows that one-fifth of SA has partially or completely migrated to online news, which can be the dominant factor for the decrease in circulation rates. The dilemma manifests itself in South Africa’s traditional largest daily newspapers in an increasingly thinning newspaper versus higher than inflationary price increases. The latter culminates in price sensitive readers who respond by purchasing their favourite daily newspaper on selective days only. The Internet of Things in South Africa will grow exponentially as data costs decrease and Internet access improves so that online media usage will grow accordingly. The growing phenomenon of digital media is changing the market landscape significantly and could have dire consequences for the newspaper publisher who does not manage any migration strategically. Is this a case of the famous newspaper cliché: “stop the press!” – especially for Afrikaans daily newspapers? The Internet undermines newspapers’advertising revenues and news became a commodity that could dramatically change the traditional business model. From the contrasting market trends pointed out in the article, it is clear that this complex news ecosystem requires interaction with the readers to pinpoint future consumer journeys. A major challenge is advertisers who now reach larger audiences with digital and broadcast media at a much lower price than those of newspaper advertising. The worrying aspect for the industry is that a loss of advertising revenue in printed newspapers has not been supplemented by an increase in revenue for digital advertising on newspaper websites or online newspapers. Although most newspapers in the world already have an online version, the majority struggle to run it profitably. The news industry is therefore still looking for a sustainable business model. Market structures are constantly changing due to market dynamics. The article indicates that in a fully competitive market, the industry’s demand and supply determine the prevailing market price, and with the concentrated media market in South Africa, several strategies can be followed to win market share. In essence, the South African media industry is oligopolistic in nature. The growing presence of complementary and substitute products in the media industry for printed newspapers has caused significant changes with the ecosystems in terms of the quantity demanded versus changes in demand. Newspaper publishers in the new fragmented media market need to make strategic decisions for sustained growth and improved operational efficiency. In response to the challenges of newspapers, several strategic considerations are proposed – a series of consolidations are already happening in the industry with larger media houses that aggressively acquired smaller competitors. Mergers and acquisitions can provide traction to newspapers and rationalize the number of major players in the industry. The above implies changing business models that are adaptable for strategic considerations to increase subscription and advertising income levels and revenue from other avenues. The strategic options aim to realize greater scale, increasing circulation and income stability. A sustained factor for the printed newspaper is the existing brand value created. Confidence will play a more important role in today’s news landscape with its escalating fake news. The research found that trends in the printed newspaper market have yielded confusing results over the last few years. It represents a world of increasing openness, media diversity and complex choices on both sides of the market. The newspaper industry in South Africa is still navigating through the many variables and hence there is no single optimizing business model. The successful transformation of the printing industry with news as commodity will be driven by relevant research data. The demand for newspapers as a whole is under pressure due to a growing consumer empowerment for other substitutes. Undoubtedly, the industry in South Africa will also increasingly integrate print and digital operations into a hybrid model with the continuous pursuit of critical mass in a multi-channel marketing landscape. For Afrikaans newspapers it implies that the business model going forward needs to be more diversified. The newspaper industry is increasingly becoming a scale business and the overall characteristic is therefore a consolidation phase that strives for optimal mixtures between the various media formats. There is still a viable demand for the printed Afrikaans newspaper, but creative innovation is required to make it sustainable. In the end, it is still market forces that will be the major determinant and, by implication, the Afrikaans reader who is going to drive the quantity demanded. © 2018 South African Academy for Science and the Arts.

The result is an unchecked environment for exploiters and attackers to distribute content such as fake, radical and propaganda videos. Recent advances in machine learning techniques have shown great promise in characterising encrypted traffic captured at the end points. However, video fingerprinting from passively listening to encrypted traffic, especially wireless traffic, has been reported as a challenging task due to the difficulty in distinguishing retransmissions and multiple flows on the same link. We show the potential of fingerprinting videos by passively sniffing WiFi frames in air, even without connecting to the WiFi network. We have developed Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that are able to identify streamed YouTube videos from a closed set, by sniffing WiFi traffic encrypted at both Media Access Control (MAC) and Network layers.

After a brief introduction to the history of this market, simple economics in both narrative and statistical form is used to plumb a number of important topics and issues. Using a unique sample of 14,000 art auction observations between 1987 and 2013 of eighty American artists born before 1950, several important topics related to art and the marketplace are examined. These include such matters as the age at which artists achieve peak productivity. Further, the authors query whether the undeniably “innovative” art being produced in the United States today is partially related to marketing and modern selling techniques rather than the age-related link most often offered as explanation. Marketing techniques and the “fairness” of auction house estimates are evaluated in this regard. Other aspects of the auction marker, such as “bought-ins” and “burning,” are also addressed. The authors show statistically that there are two basic markets for American art: that produced prior to 1950 and that (post-1950) labeled “contemporary.” Investment in the latter, the authors conclude, may be far more remunerative. The disturbing issues of art crime, money laundering with art, fakes, and fraud are analyzed, with the costs and benefits of such activities in mind, as are the issues of the impact of an artist’s death and the appearance of bubbles in the art market. © Oxford University Press 2017.

Recently, the term “data fraud” has replaced the past concept of data falsification. Data fraud is a boarder umbrella use to represent to more serious activities beyond the traditionally acknowledged potential categorical types of errors acknowledge exist within and of the different processes making up marketing research activities (e.g., respondent, sampling, scale measurement, data analysis errors). Today, marketing research industry experts (methodologists) suggest that data fraud comes from many sources and costs buyers of research data and reported findings billions of dollars for useless and/or misleading information. Some experts indicate that the bad information directly influences poor managerial decisions leading to even greater losses in the billions. For example, within the mobile advertising industry, digital marketers recognize that data fraud has evolved from fake traffic numbers generated by bots to fabricated data passed on by publishers. In contrast, there has been very little formal discussion about data fraud and its sources within academic-oriented research. The over objective of this session is to create a meaningful dialogue among academic researchers on disturbing data fraud issues and sources associated with conducting academic research and the consequences affecting not only data quality but also reported results, findings, implications, and the body of marketing knowledge. Discussion topics will focus on types of data fraud sources (activities), methods for detecting data fraud activities, as well as methods for controlling data fraud behaviors.

Nowadays, popular online social sites as Twitter, Facebook and Google+ are among the major news sources as well as the most effective channels for viral marketing. However, these networks also became the most effective channel for spreading misinformation, accidentally or maliciously. The widespread diffusion of inaccurate information or fake news can lead to undesirable and severe consequences, such as widespread panic, libelous campaigns and conspiracies. In order to guarantee the trustworthiness of online social networks it is a crucial challenge to find effective strategies to contrast the spread of the misinformation in the network. In this paper we concentrate our attention on two problems related to the diffusion of misinformation in social networks: identify the misinformation sources and limit its diffusion in the network. We consider a social network where some nodes have already been infected from misinformation. We first provide an heuristics to recognize the set of most probable sources of the infection. Then, we provide an heuristics to place a few monitors in some network nodes in order to control information diffused by the suspected nodes and block misinformation they injected in the network before it reaches a large part of the network. To verify the quality and efficiency of our suggested solutions, we conduct experiments on several real-world networks. Empirical results indicate that our heuristics are among the most effective known in literature. © Copyright 2017, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

Therefore, the providers would not be financially motivated to establish secure OSN designs based on users’ data encryption. Addressing these problems, we propose the first Privacy Preserving Group-Based Advertising (PPAD) system that gives monetizing ability for the OSN providers.

That is because the interaction in those media is often different since most of them are private. This work is therefore devoted to focus merely on Twitter and deemed to be within the confines of Data Mining. It is concerned with Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based sentiment analysis for Twitter's opinion mining. As such, the objective of this work is to use a data mining approach of text-feature extraction, classification, and dimensionality reduction, using sentiment analysis to analyze and visualize Twitter users' opinion. The utilized methodology is based on applying sentiment analysis NLP on a large number of tweets in order to get word scoring of the tweet and thus to exploit public tweeting for knowledge discovery. This will moreover serve for fake news detection. The pertinent mechanism involves several consecutive steps, namely: dataset collection stage, the pre-processing stage, NLP stage, sentiment analysis stage, and prediction and classification stage using BNN. The U.S. Airlines Sentiment Analysis Twitter dataset has been utilized which is already provided with Data for Everyone. The presented system is monitoring Twitter streams from both the media and the public. It is capable to extract meaningful data from tweets in real-time and store them into a relational model for analysis. And then use our dimension reduction method. This will help people discover the correlation of the leading role between them, which also reflects news media's focuses and people's interests. This system has proved better results with respect to accuracy and efficiency in comparison with some other similar works.

Surprisingly, no marketing study to date has analyzed the effect of fake news on consumers’ evaluations of a brand advertised on the same webpage. To fill this gap, this study empirically investigated whether individuals’ perceptions of fake news transfer to an adjacent brand advertisement. Specifically, we manipulated news truthfulness and source credibility, observing the change in individuals’ responses while distinguishing between objective truthfulness and the perceived credibility of the news. The results confirmed that the news’ objective truthfulness exerts no direct effect on behavioral intentions toward the brand (i.e., intention to purchase, spread word-of-mouth, or visit the brand's store). However, we did uncover a chain of effects whereby the impact of fake news on behavioral intentions was fully mediated by people's perceptions of the news’ credibility, which affected the perceived credibility of the sources, which then influenced brand trust, which finally translated into brand attitudes.

We surveyed dominant Twitter communications about e-cigarettes and smoking cessation, examining message sources, themes, and attitudes. Methods: Tweets from 2014 were searched for mentions of e-cigarettes and smoking cessation. A purposive sample was subjected to mixed-methods analysis. Results: Twitter communication about e-cigarettes increased fivefold since 2012. In a sample of 300 tweets from high-authority users, attitudes about e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids were favorable across user types (industry, press, public figures, fake accounts, and personal users), except for public health professionals, who lacked consensus and contributed negligibly to the conversation. The most prevalent message themes were marketing, news, and first-person experiences with e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids. We identified several industry strategies to reach Twitter users.

Efforts to assess drug standards worldwide have almost exclusively focused on anti-microbial drugs; with no study to date on cardiovascular drugs. Our study aims to assess quality of seven routinely used cardiovascular medications (anticoagulants, antihypertensives and statins) in ten Sub-Saharan African countries. Methods Drugs were prospectively collected using standardized methods between 2012 and 2014 from licensed (random pharmacies) and unlicensed (street-markets) places of sale in Africa. We developed a validated reversed-phase liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method to accurately quantify the active ingredient in a certified public laboratory. Three quality categories were defined based on the ratio of the measured to the expected dosage of the active ingredient: A (good quality): 95% to 105%, B (low quality): 85 to 94.99% or 105.01 to 115%, C (very low quality): < 85% or > 115%. Results All expected medicines (n = 3468 samples) were collected in Benin, Burkina-Faso, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire, Mauritania, Niger, Togo and Senegal. Out of the 1530 samples randomly tested, poor quality (types B and C) was identified in 249 (16.3%) samples. The prevalence of poor quality was significantly increased in certain specific drugs (amlodipine 29% and captopril 26%), in generic versions (23%) and in drugs produced in Asia (35%). The proportion of poor quality reached 50% when drugs produced in Asia were sold in street-markets. Conclusion In this first study assessing the quality of cardiovascular drugs in Africa, we found a significant proportion of poor quality drugs. This requires continued monitoring strategies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Generally, big organizations, politicians, celebrities, and journalists require a huge number of followers/fans to promote and manage their reputation on Online Social Networks such as Twitter. This demand of more followers has originated Twitter Followers Market that deals with the sale and purchase of fake/compromised Twitter accounts. In this paper, an analysis of merchants of this marketing industry has been conducted using graph- and content-based features. The present study has been conducted by collecting 15,750 tweets related to the sale or purchase of Twitter followers posted by around 995 users. The analysis infers that the merchants of this marketing industry fulfill the characteristics of spammers as stated by the rules and policies of Twitter. Further, machine learning classification approach has been used to categorize these merchants from genuine users based on their behavioral features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the novel study to analyze and then categorize the behavior of such merchants involved in the sale of Twitter accounts as spammers. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Detection of such an infection is challenging due to its similarity to legitimate advertising activities. An interesting observation we make in our research is that such an attack almost always incurs a great semantic gap between the infected domain (e.g., a university site) and the content it promotes (e.g., selling cheap viagra). Exploiting this gap, we developed a semantic-based technique, called Semantic Inconsistency Search (SEISE), for efficient and accurate detection of the promotional injections on sponsored top-level domains (sTLD) with explicit semantic meanings. Our approach utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify the bad terms (those related to illicit activities like fake drug selling, etc.) most irrelevant to an sTLD's semantics. These terms, which we call irrelevant bad terms (IBTs), are used to query search engines under the sTLD for suspicious domains. Through a semantic analysis on the results page returned by the search engines, SEISE is able to detect those truly infected sites and automatically collect new IBTs from the titles/URLs/snippets of their search result items for finding new infections. Running on 403 sTLDs with an initial 30 seed IBTs, SEISE analyzed 100K fully qualified domain names (FQDN), and along the way automatically gathered nearly 600 IBTs. In the end, our approach detected 11K infected FQDN with a false detection rate of 1.5% and over 90% coverage. Our study shows that by effective detection of infected sTLDs, the bar to promotion infections can be substantially raised, since other non-sTLD vulnerable domains typically have much lower Alexa ranks and are therefore much less attractive for underground advertising. Our findings further bring to light the stunning impacts of such promotional attacks, which compromise FQDNs under 3% of.edu,.gov domains and over one thousand gov.cn domains, including those of leading universities such as stanford.edu, mit.edu, princeton.edu, havard.edu and government institutes such as nsf.gov and nih.gov. We further demonstrate the potential to extend our current technique to protect generic domains such as.com and.org. © 2016 IEEE."

In particular, Facebook pages are increasingly used by businesses, brands, and organizations to connect with multitudes of users worldwide. As the number of likes of a page has become a de-facto measure of its popularity and profitability, an underground market of services artificially inflating page likes (""like farms"") has emerged alongside Facebook's official targeted advertising platform. Nonetheless, besides a fewmedia reports, there is littlework that systematically analyzes Facebook pages' promotion methods. Aiming to fill this gap, we present a honeypotbased comparative measurement study of page likes garnered via Facebook advertising and from popular like farms. First, we analyze likes based on demographic, temporal, and social characteristics and find that some farms seem to be operated by bots and do not really try to hide the nature of their operations, while others follow a stealthier approach, mimicking regular users' behavior. Next, we look at fraud detection algorithms currently deployed by Facebook and show that they do not work well to detect stealthy farms that spread likes over longer timespans and like popular pages to mimic regular users. To overcome their limitations, we investigate the feasibility of timeline-based detection of like farm accounts, focusing on characterizing content generated by Facebook accounts on their timelines as an indicator of genuine versus fake social activity. We analyze a wide range of features extracted from timeline posts, which we group into two main categories: lexical and non-lexical.We find that like farm accounts tend to re-share content more often, use fewer words and poorer vocabulary, and more often generate duplicate comments and likes compared to normal users. Using relevant lexical and non-lexical features, we build a classifier to detect like farms accounts that achieves a precision higher than 99% and a 93% recall. © 2017 ACM."

With this increase, luxury goods are not only consumed by rich people alone. For this reason, luxury brands are expanding their target population and enriching their products and services accordingly. Thus, the luxury market which addresses the middle-and upper-middle-income groups is changing and its importance is increasing. In this chapter, the definition of luxury, the classification of luxury goods, the requirements of the luxury marketing mix (product, price, distribution and promotion) and applied strategies are examined. This chapter also covers how luxury products have authentic features, premium and masstige brands, fake luxury products that are the exact copies of original luxury brands, and how and why this fake luxury market grows. At the end of the chapter, the luxury market in Turkey, which has been growing rapidly, especially in recent years, is examined in detail and all the features of the market are presented. It is expected that this market will continue to grow in the future, as a large number of tourists from nearby regions, Central Asia and Arab countries come to Turkey to buy luxury branded products and services. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

In this article, we examine the manipulation of one such resource, aspiration, used in performing and mocking one such clichéd character, called the fake Sámi. This character has a contested history in Finnish tourism and marketing practices, and is embedded in a long-standing debate about who can use emblems of Sámi identity for economic purposes. Adopting a sociophonetic language regard and folk linguistics approaches (Preston 2010; Niedzielski & Preston 2003) we explore how “fakeness” is constructed phonetically by the actors performing “Fake Sámi” in an indigenous Sámi television comedy show during a period of intense political debate in Finland over the legal definition of the category of indigenous Sámi. By analysing the use of hyperbolic aspiration of a prominent feature of Lappish Finnish dialect, the non-initial syllable/h/-sound, we show how the fakeness is performed by evoking linguistic stereotypes of a Finnish Lappish dialect and a Finnish English accent by a deliberate misuse of aspiration: aspirating when standard phonemes in speech should not be aspirated and not aspirating when phonemes should be aspirated. We argue that this kind of deliberate ambivalence and misuse of phonetic resources is a phonetic resource for reflexive postmodern identity performances. © John Benjamins Publishing Company."

Though, with changes in economy, advanced technology and innovative marketing, the rural population is exploited by way of poor quality products and services, common shortages leads to black marketing, irrational pricing, promotions and others. To accord with it, this study intends to identify the various factors inducing the purchase of FMCG products in both rural and urban areas and the level of impact on these factors towards the purchase of fake FMCG products. Methods/ Analysis: This study is conducted in rural and urban areas of Madurai District in Tamil Nadu which is considered primarily as the universe of the present study. The present study comprising of 20 villages in Madurai District consisting of 100 rural sample respondents and also covered 100 sample respondents from Madurai city (urban). Thus, the researcher has used multistage simple random sampling technique within the sampling frame to collect the urban and rural responses for the study. This study depends mainly on primary data. A structured interview schedule (in regional language) was constructed and administered to collect primary data among the rural and urban groups for a period of one month from November 2015 to December 2015. Findings: The study findings pointed out that urban consumers were influenced by 'conviction' and 'appeal' factors and the rural consumers were influenced by 'conviction' and 'promotions' during their purchase behavior towards fake FMCG products. Thus, an integrated approach including representative from corporate firms, retailer forum, sales executives is needed to empower the rural and urban consumers by way of including consumer education, training for government enforcement officials, research and statistical analysis, public policy analysis and support for policy development and sharing global best practices information. Applications/Improvement: This study has given a new acumen in the field of creating consumer awareness towards purchasing of fake products among rural population."

However, it also triggers the unseen security threats. We found that the phone scams with fake calling numbers of very short lifetime are increasingly popular and have been used to trick the users. The harm is worldwide. On the other hand, deceptive advertising (deceptive ads), the fake ads that tricks users to install unnecessary apps via either alluring or daunting texts and pictures, is an emerging threat that seriously harms the reputation of the advertiser. To counter against these two new threats, the conventional blacklist (or whitelist) approach and the machine learning approach with predefined features have been proven useless. Nevertheless, due to the success of deep learning in developing the highly intelligent program, our system can efficiently and effectively detect phone scams and deceptive ads by taking advantage of our unified framework on deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN).

We first detect the ecommerce websites (including shopbots) present in the list of search results and then discriminate between legitimate and fake ecommerce websites. We identify suitable learning features for each stage and show through a prototype system termed RI.SI.CO. that this approach is feasible, fast, and highly effective. Experimenting with one goods sector, we found that RI.SI.CO. achieved better classification accuracy than that of non-expert humans. We next show that the information extracted by our method can be used to generate sector-level 'counterfeiting charts' that allow us to analyze and compare the counterfeit risk associated with different brands in a same sector. We also show that the risk of coming across counterfeit websites is affected by the particular web search engine and type of search query used by shoppers.

These events, as well as many others, caused a shift in political science and exposed a need for the reconsideration of the impact of online space on the development of socio-political systems all over the world. Besides, these events exposed a research need for political content studies in the online space at micro and macro-levels. The online processes are complex and non-linear, thus, require complex and hybrid analytical methods - for example, a combination of network analysis, mathematic analysis and linguistic and discourse analysis - the tools used by the authors of the article to study the political content produced during the Trump's US Presidential Campaign 2016. The purpose of the research was to identify the peculiarities of political content production and the impact it could have on prospective voters (such as shaping public opinion, agitation and construction of a required expected behavior). The empirical foundation of the research is metadata of the social networks, required for a network analysis; likewise, the text corpus, a set of messages produced by D. Trump's team during the US Presidential Campaign 2016 in the same social networks, was the empirical base for linguistic discourse analysis. The network analysis, which originates from the theory of complex networks, was applied to study of the process of political content consumption by online users (prospective and active voter groups), and in particular, how the production capacity of social network users, as regards the produced or spread political content, can determine their roles (the opinion leaders, the sensors, the implementers, the readers, the reputation players). The linguistic discourse analysis allowed to identify the key peculiarities of the researched political content, produced as a part of a successful marketing campaign (aimed at promoting a candidate for the presidency) in social networks and online space as a whole. The study of the Trump's US Political Campaign 2016 revealed that the online dominance, acquired via social network marketing (which is a result of communicative strategies exploitation), can convert into a political dominance in the offline space. © Polis.

Two algorithms are then proposed to recognize similar reviews and relevant reviews from all reviews. Compared to the traditional algorithm, our review identification algorithm achieves shorter execution time. More importantly, the proposed algorithm for recognizing relevant reviews can be used to analyze the relevancy between the review content and the given review topic by using the automatic word segmentation technique. The Experimental results show that the number of fake reviews by our algorithms is higher than that of the traditional algorithm.

Farmers were not getting fair price for the produce, low bargaining power when selling the produce, improper support from the government, high price fluctuations, improper grading etc. The findings of the study showed there is a strong relationship between opinion on marketing problems and operational efficiency of agricultural market committees in the case of provision and maintenance, licensing control and rationalization of market charges. The market committee has to increase amenities like water facilities in summer season, sheds in rainy season etc. The market committee members should have close monitoring over licensing and controlling due to that fake commission agents will reduce.

Cosplay is a significant example of this: a widespread phenomenon of costume and role-playing inspired by characters taken from science fiction, manga, and the world of superheroes. Cosplay's use of superhero equipment highlights the pleasures related to constructing and exhibiting costumes in a culture of individual adaptability, nurtured by fantasies of transformation involving the body. This process is assisted by an increasing 'democratization' of fashion, introduced by the globalization of fashion industry and an evolving fashion economy that has flooded the market with reproductions and fakes.

We investigate the economic incentives to commit review fraud on the popular review platform Yelp, using two complementary approaches and data sets. We begin by analyzing restaurant reviews that are identified by Yelp's filtering algorithm as suspicious, or fake-and treat these as a proxy for review fraud (an assumption we provide evidence for). We present four main findings. First, roughly 16% of restaurant reviews on Yelp are filtered. These reviews tend to be more extreme (favorable or unfavorable) than other reviews, and the prevalence of suspicious reviews has grown significantly over time. Second, a restaurant is more likely to commit review fraud when its reputation is weak, i.e., when it has few reviews or it has recently received bad reviews. Third, chain restaurants-which benefit less from Yelp-are also less likely to commit review fraud. Fourth, when restaurants face increased competition, they become more likely to receive unfavorable fake reviews. Using a separate data set, we analyze businesses that were caught soliciting fake reviews through a sting conducted by Yelp.

Recently, it has attracted the attention of research community due to it's potential applications in forensic, security, marketing, fake profiles identification on online social networking sites, capturing sender of harassing messages etc. We need benchmark corpora to develop and evaluate techniques for author profiling. Majority of the existing corpora are for English and other European languages but not for under–resourced South Asian languages, like Roman Urdu (written using English alphabets). Roman Urdu is used in daily communication by a large number of native speakers of Urdu around the world particularly in Facebook posts/comments, Twitter tweets, blogs, chat blogs and SMS messaging. The construction of sentences of Urdu while using alphabets of English transforms the language properties of the text. We aim to investigate the behavior of existing author profiling techniques for multilingual text consisting of English and Roman Urdu, concretely for gender and age identification. We here focus on author profiling on Facebook by (i) developing a multilingual (Roman Urdu and English) corpus, (ii) manually building of a bilingual dictionary for translating Roman Urdu words into English, (iii) modeling existing state-of-the-art author profiling techniques by using content based features (word and character N–grams) and 64 different stylistic based features (11 lexical word based features, 47 lexical character based features and 6 vocabulary richness measures) for age and gender identification on multilingual and translated corpora, (iv) evaluating and comparing the behavior of above mentioned techniques on multilingual and translated corpora. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that (i) existing author profiling techniques can be used for multilingual text (Roman Urdu + English) as well as monolingual text (corpus obtained after translating multilingual corpus using bilingual dictionary), (ii) content based methods outperform stylistic based methods for both gender and age identification task and (iii) translation of multilingual corpus to monolingual text does not improve results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

This paper conceptualizes counterfeit or fake branding at a cultural process level to more clearly illuminate the persistent marketing problem. First, we discuss the counterfeit-brand issue, then introduce the theory of mimesis to illuminate consumers’ relationships with counterfeit brands and issues of cultural appropriation.

Counterfeit parts may not meet safety standards and may be produced using inferior materials, even though they look and feel identical to a brand name one. And, like other counterfeit goods, the sale of pirated auto parts has been linked to organized crime and terrorist organizations. Most counterfeit auto parts in North America are imported, according to a report from the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association. A large percentage is produced in China, which accounts for more than 80 percent of the goods seized at U.S. borders. Consumers can protect themselves against fakes by only conducting business with reputable repair shops or with the manufacturer's dealership network. Consumers should also use caution when purchasing auto parts on the Internet. OEMs and their suppliers should make sourcing decisions wisely and consider more than just the landed cost of imported parts."

Counterfeit products have been observed to be a significant issue around the world that destroy economic exercises as well as it influences social life. Therefore, this study aims to identify the determinants that influence the repurchase intention towards counterfeit products among consumers' using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) framework.

Traditional approaches either heavily depend on underlying diffusion models and are not optimized for popularity prediction, or use complicated hand-crafted features that cannot be easily generalized to different types of cascades. Recent generative approaches allow for understanding the spreading mechanisms, but with unsatisfactory prediction accuracy. To capture both the underlying structures governing the spread of information and inherent dependencies between re-tweeting behaviors of users, we propose a semi-supervised method, called Recurrent Cascades Convolutional Networks (CasCN), which explicitly models and predicts cascades through learning the latent representation of both structural and temporal information, without involving any other features. In contrast to the existing single, undirected and stationary Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), CasCN is a novel multi-directional/dynamic GCN. Our experiments conducted on real-world datasets show that CasCN significantly improves the prediction accuracy and reduces the computational cost compared to state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 IEEE."

The purpose of this research is to study the specific features of the emergence and evolution context of the 'Fake news' communication technology. The methodological basis for the analysis is the multiparadigm approach, which allows to combine heuristic potentials of the system-sociological methodology, interactive approach and theory of communicative action. Secondary sources devoted to the problems of modern political communications, as well as thematic content of social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, VKontakte, etc., were the empirical base. The following results were obtained during the performed analysis. Firstly, in recent years the toolkit of modern political communications has been expanding, which testifies to the development of a well-known 'electronic or monitoring democracy', which sometimes is referred to as a democracy of inclusive observation over the activities of ruling political class. At the same time, the mass media are increasingly interfacing with the political space in terms of the use of new information technologies in political communications. Secondly, the role of social media as a channel of political communication is growing. Within the framework of these media, social networks playing a growing role in the political mobilization of masses are becoming the most popular. Thereby, political actors obtain a possibility to coordinate their actions. Thirdly, advertising of political communications takes place. It is expressed in the subordination of political and communication interactions to the laws of advertising business concerning formation of political image of famous leaders. Advertising is supplemented by marketing of political communications, which consists in its impact on electorate by means of resources of 'personal', 'software' and 'information' influence in order to gain a place in the state and municipal power system. It is ac-companied by distortion and fabrication of facts, tendentious and one-sided editing of misinfor-mation, discrediting of opponents with abnormal rhetoric, labelling and trolling. Three conditions described above constitute the context thanks to which, the 'fake news' influence increasingly on political communications. The term 'Fake news' is recognized as an expression of 2017 and refers to knowingly false, sensational information disseminated under the guise of news, which also includes the biased journalism, propaganda, hidden advertising, 'post-telling' and trolling. Features of the 'Fake news' communication technology are the following: high speed of distribution of such messages, wider coverage of audience, difficulties of their identification. Different countries, de-spite the national, cultural and political differences, are trying to fight against the fake news both jointly and separately. In order to limit the impact of the 'Fake news' on modern political communications, active countermeasures are being taken by social networks themselves (e.g. Facebook labels them as controversial). However, notable results have not yet been achieved. As a result, fakes have become a threat not only to the mass media and democracy as a whole, but also started to create 'obstacles' for political and communication interaction between the real political actors. Researchers have to make additional efforts to analyse online reports in order to ensure the reliability of information disseminated and guarantee that it does not involve fake misinformation. © 2019 IEEE."

For this, 50 perfumes were used (25 original and 25 counterfeit) for the analysis of ions (ion chromatography) and ethanol (gas chromatography). The results demonstrated that the fake perfume had low levels of ethanol and high levels of chloride compared to the original product. The data were treated by chemometric tools such as principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis.

This makes consumer reviews important for anyone seeking to sell products and services both inside and outside the sharing economy. The eWOM literature largely focuses on review authenticity and credibility from the point of view of fake online reviews (i.e., astroturfing), such as reviews created by business owners or generated using artificial intelligence (c.f. Castillo et al. 2013) or the deletion of negative reviews (c.f. Bamman et al. 2012). However, there is scant attention given to customer reviews and ratings that do not reflect customers’ true opinions and feelings of their experience. For example, consider ridesharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, where consumers have little knowledge outside of the numerical evaluation ratings other customers give their drivers. On these platforms, researchers have observed rating inflation where customers give drivers top marks even when things go wrong and expectations are not met (Cook 2015; Etzioni 2017). This pattern of rating inflation exists in other sharing economy contexts as well including, notably, the accommodation sharing industry (Zervas et al. 2015, 2014). This article proposes that customers perceive an organization’s own market label by processing marketing positioning information, such as those found on websites. A market label is a metaphoric word or phrase that expresses an organization’s identity and constructs relationships between the organization and other stakeholders. This paper examines whether the customer reviews and the sentiment within them corresponds to how an organization positions or presents itself in the marketplace. Specifically, we introduce the professional and amateur market labels and analyze the impact of the organization’s sales pitches.

However, the diversity and popularity of online social networks attract malicious users to inject new forms of spam. Spamming is a malicious activity where a fake user spreads unsolicited messages in the form of bulk message, fraudulent review, malware/virus, hate speech, profanity, or advertising for marketing scam. In addition, it is found that spammers usually form a connected community of spam accounts and use them to spread spam to a large set of legitimate users. Consequently, it is highly desirable to detect such spammer communities existing in social networks. Even though a significant amount of work has been done in the field of detecting spam messages and accounts, not much research has been done in detecting spammer communities and hidden spam accounts. In this work, an unsupervised approach called SpamCom is proposed for detecting spammer communities in Twitter. We model the Twitter network as a multilayer social network and exploit the existence of overlapping community-based features of users represented in the form of Hypergraphs to identify spammers based on their structural behavior and URL characteristics.

Estimates suggest that the counterfeit industry is now $75 billion and will grow by 20 % per year, making it one of the fastest growing public health risks [Poison pills. The Economist. 2012]. Counterfeit medications, comprising more than 30 % of medications in parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, have only recently gained recognition by the general public and mainstream media. Although the burden of disease lies largely with the world’s most vulnerable populations, Western countries are not insulated from this problem [The deadly world of fake drugs, Washington, DC]. With the rapid growth of online pharmacies, the currently quoted 1 % prevalence of counterfeit medications in the United States will quickly rise [World Health Organization, IMPACT. Counterfeit drugs kill! 2008]. The Internet, which boasts up to 50 % prevalence of counterfeit pharmaceuticals, has introduced medications such as blood pressure control, lifestyle medications, and pain modulators to the list of counterfeited medications. The traditional definition of counterfeit medications, including both generic and brand name, is medications deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled with respect to identity and/or source [Counterfeit medical products: report by the secretariat. Geneva]. In some instances, counterfeiting involves manufacturing a drug without its active ingredient-with chalk, starch, flour, or talcum powder in place of any active compound. Although less harmful than some of the more menacing manufacturing techniques, this approach puts patients at risk of morbidity and mortality from otherwise treatable diseases. In a more sinister approach, these formulations can be made with substitute medications providing relief of symptoms but not treatment of disease, for example, filling an antimalarial with acetaminophen, which will lower the fever of malaria but will not treat the underlying parasite. Other medications may have active ingredients but at nontherapeutic doses. This “up marketing” of medications runs the risk of creating resistance in the partially treated host. These substandard medications subject patients to treatment failures and create drug-resistant organisms. Lastly, and perhaps the most publicized aspect of this issue, is the inclusion of noxious chemicals in medications marketed as therapeutic pharmaceuticals. Most notoriously, in place of the glycerin normally used in cough syrup, the toxic substance diethylene glycol has been used because of its similar taste, color, consistency, and lower cost. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals thus have significant public health consequences beyond their individual-level effects. These falsified medications jeopardize the primary care environment by undermining people’s faith in their physicians and making them question the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain. This chapter will provide an overview of drug counterfeiting globally, describe its potential impact for urbanization and health, and discuss various mechanisms to address this problem. © Springer New York 2015."

And then how we can measure it's influence on overall shopping pattern. We try to answer the question by proposing a simulation model with the help of animats (artificial customers), whereby animats become aware of other animats' real-time shopping inventory and may hence be influenced by their purchases and the levels of purchases. This simulation sets to provide the answers of questions like the percentage of increase in sales given real-time purchase information to other customers, and a platform to generate herd behavior. This paper provides several dimensions to look for influencing customers via feedback, real-time marketing, target advertisement and on-demand promotions. Several other parameters have been discussed including the herd behavior, fake customers, privacy, and optimality of sales-price margin to name a few."

While many users use social networking sites to connect and maintain contact, attackers may see social networks as a prime target for spreading malware, propaganda or marketing. Many activities can thus be carried out using these platforms- both malicious and beneficial in nature. Social networking sites can be used for social engineering attacks as users may be eager to interact and engage with a new contact made on a social networking site. However, they may not be aware that the profile they are engaging with may be valid. In addition, malware is also being developed to target users of social networking sites. This paper entails the investigation of the reasons that users trust these sites. Users develop trust based on certain factors. Survey data is presented to indicate some of these trust factors. Users will also maintain a certain level of privacy based on the trust is established. Therefore, identifying why users trust social networking sites can be beneficial in understanding why certain information is divulged. Therefore, important questions that need to be answered are why do people trust these platforms and how much do users trust these platforms. These factors are important for security awareness to protect users from being attacked with social engineering techniques. Social engineering makes use of trust as a component to influence users to perform actions detrimental to themselves and others. In addition, this paper users survey data to determine whether users are aware of these potential malicious objectives. Thereafter, the paper looks at the various indicators that could signal to users that they are not communicating with a genuine user but instead a fake profile. Another goal of this paper is to show users the dangers of social networking malware before they infect themselves. Once insight is gained into the trust factors, the study can also show users how social networking sites can be manipulated and thus help users protect themselves against being the target of attacks."

The most common form of malicious activity over OSNs is spamming wherein a bot (fake user) disseminates content, malware/viruses, etc. to the legitimate users of the social networks. The common motives behind such activity include phishing, scams, viral marketing and so on which the recipients do not indent to receive. It is thus a highly desirable task to devise techniques and methods for identifying spammers (spamming accounts) in OSNs. With an aim of exploiting social network characteristics of community formation by legitimate users, this paper presents a community-based framework to identify spammers in OSNs. The framework uses community-based features of OSN users to learn classification models for identification of spamming accounts. The preliminary experiments on a real-world dataset with simulated spammers reveal that proposed approach is promising and that using community-based node features of OSN users can improve the performance of classifying spammers and legitimate users Copyright 2013 ACM."

Recent police reports of record amount of marijuana seized and numerous arrests are evidence that the production and consumption of marijuana is on the rise. Lately, a newer and potentially more problematic group of chemicals, so called synthetic marijuana, became available on the streets. Its appearance as an herbal mixture fools the interested crowd that it is a natural, and therefore presumed to be safe, substance that can be used to have a “good time” or seek new experiences. Its cheaper price attracts younger individuals who cannot afford marijuana. Difficulties in detecting it in blood or urine samples make it more attractive to most marijuana users who already have trouble with the legal system. While structurally different, synthetic marijuana compounds bind to the same cannabinoid receptors in the brain and peripheral organs and convey similar pharmacological properties as Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive constituent of marijuana. However, synthetic marijuana is more potent than naturally-occurring THC, causing serious, and at times lethal, outcomes. Due to the imminent hazards to public safety, urgent regulations including criminal, civil and administrative penalties, sanctions and regulatory controls of substances should be imposed on the manufacture, distribution, possession and importation of these synthetic cannabinoids. © 2014, Cukurova Univ Tip Fakultesi Psikiyatri Anabilim Dali.

Methods and Findings: With evidence of a deteriorating situation, a group of police, criminal analysts, chemists, palynologists, and health workers collaborated to determine the source of these counterfeits under the auspices of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) and the Western Pacific World Health Organization Regional Office. A total of 391 samples of genuine and counterfeit artesunate collected in Vietnam (75), Cambodia (48), Lao PDR (115), Myanmar (Burma) (137) and the Thai/Myanmar border (16), were available for analysis. Sixteen different fake hologram types were identified. High-performance liquid chromatography and/or mass spectrometry confirmed that all specimens thought to be counterfeit (195/391, 49.9%) on the basis of packaging contained no or small quantities of artesunate (up to 12 mg per tablet as opposed to ∼ 50 mg per genuine tablet). Chemical analysis demonstrated a wide diversity of wrong active ingredients, including banned pharmaceuticals, such as metamizole, and safrole, a carcinogen, and raw material for manufacture of methylenedioxymethamphetamine ('ecstasy'). Evidence from chemical, mineralogical, biological, and packaging analysis suggested that at least some of the counterfeits were manufactured in southeast People's Republic of China. This evidence prompted the Chinese Government to act quickly against the criminal traders with arrests and seizures. Conclusions: An international multi-disciplinary group obtained evidence that some of the counterfeit artesunate was manufactured in China, and this prompted a criminal investigation. International cross-disciplinary collaborations may be appropriate in the investigation of other serious counterfeit medicine public health problems elsewhere, but strengthening of international collaborations and forensic and drug regulatory authority capacity will be required. © 2008 Newton et al."

The illegal production, sale and distribution of fake drugs is a huge market evaluated to several billion of dollars and represents more than 50% of the pharmaceutical market in several African countries. Fake drugs have led to a very great number of deaths from untreated malaria or fatality provoked by toxic ingredients. These fake medicines increase the risk of artemisinin resistance developed by the use of sub therapeutic dosages of antimalarials. Tackling this criminal traffic is the objective of an international program created by WHO and involves the international police and custom organizations like INTERPOL. Several very important and encouraging results have been obtained, but the problem will be completely solved if genuine antimalarials, free-of-charge, are handed-over to populations in sub Sahara African countries."

Online reviews are one form of consumer information which is gaining increasing commercial value and consumer influence. Retailers, marketers, PR firms, competitors and commercial online review providers are all implicated in exploiting this situation through the strategic creation and dissemination of fake online reviews. Recent studies suggest that fake online review prevalence is escalating and representing a growing problem in terms of online informational accuracy and potentially, market regulation. The UK Advertising Standards Authority has already found against TripAdvisor in this regard and other ubiquitous, highly popular review platforms are increasingly being examined by regulators for review accuracy as well. This paper considers fake online reviews and their potentials to mislead consumers, breach consumer laws and to undermine market efficacy. An examination of Australian law reveals that misleading and deceptive conduct and false testimonials in the form of fake online reviews are potentially actionable and that cases are starting to emerge which justify regulatory action. The paper also considers potential legal, technical and industry solutions, such as mandating best practice fake review detection and increasing enforcement and consumer education actions.

Then we present features that could be potentially helpful in detecting spam opinions in threads. The results of spam detection on first posts show: (1) spam first posts put more focus on certain topics such as the user experiences' on the promoted items, (2) spam first posts generally use more words and pictures to showcase the promoted items in an attempt to impress people, (3) spam first posts tend to be submitted during work time, and (4) the threads that spam first posts initiate are more active to be placed at striking positions. The spam detection on replies is more challenging. Besides lower spam ratio and less content, replies even do not mention the promoted items.

This on-the-street cheap pricing cannot remunerate the effort of the musicians neither does it benefit to the pirates. The issues of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) need to be respected in all forms of art.

This paper seeks to answer the following questions: What should be done to improve music production and supply processes in Zimbabwe and South Africa? Who is to blame for this rampant music piracy in the Southern African countries - the information technologist who reproduces a music CD illegally or the musician? Management of art is complex and a number of musicians are not educated enough and thus have no basic business management knowledge and skills. This paper critiques the illegal act of music piracy in Zimbabwe and South African, and seeks to establish a music industry model of musical art marketing and sales towards profitability for music composers and producers.

Through three experiments, two using a real website of a popular brand and one using a fake recruitment site, we show that MM increases purchase intentions through the mediating influence of perceived benevolence. The influence of perceived benevolence on purchase intentions is, in turn, mediated by indebtedness and brand trust. Further, consumers reward MM even if it directly promotes the brand.

Many times, different plant species are commercialized in the place of the one recognized by the pharmacopoeia. This may occur due to the difficulties of obtaining the authentic plant material, or by an intentional use of a plant species that has less economic value but shows similar morphologic features. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out studies that can identify the chemical composition of those species of wide medicinal use, which are the targets of adulterations. Mikania glomerata and Mikania laevigata, popularly known as ""guaco"", are indistinctly commercialized in Brazil. A phytochemical screening by TLC was carried out to evaluate the chemical composition of both species. The RP-HPLC profiles were obtained and the quantification of coumarin was determined by the same method. A phytochemical screening has shown that coumarin, triterpenes/steroids and flavonic heterosides are the constituents detected in both species. The RP-HPLC profiles were similar between the two species and revealed the predominance of polar compounds. In the quantification of coumarin, a content of 0.30% (w/w) was obtained for M. glomerata and 0.43% (w/w) for M. laevigata. These values are in accord with the contents (min. 0.1%, w/w) described by the monograph of ""guaco-cheiroso"" in the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia. Therefore, the results indicated similar chemical profiles for M. glomerata and M. laevigata, as well as comparable coumarin contents, thus suggesting that the species might be used indistinctly."

Counterfeit oral artesunate has been a major public health problem in mainland SE Asia, impeding malaria control. A countrywide stratified random survey was performed to determine the availability and quality of oral artesunate in pharmacies and outlets (shops selling medicines) in the Lao PDR (Laos). Methods. In 2003, 'mystery' shoppers were asked to buy artesunate tablets from 180 outlets in 12 of the 18 Lao provinces. Outlets were selected using stratified random sampling by investigators not involved in sampling. Samples were analysed for packaging characteristics, by the Fast Red Dye test, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry (MS), X-ray diffractometry and pollen analysis. Results. Of 180 outlets sampled, 25 (13.9%) sold oral artesunate. Outlets selling artesunate were more commonly found in the more malarious southern Laos. Of the 25 outlets, 22 (88%; 95%CI 68-97%) sold counterfeit artesunate, as defined by packaging and chemistry. No artesunate was detected in the counterfeits by any of the chemical analysis techniques and analysis of the packaging demonstrated seven different counterfeit types. There was complete agreement between the Fast Red dye test, HPLC and MS analysis. A wide variety of wrong active ingredients were found by MS. Of great concern, 4/27 (14.8%) fakes contained detectable amounts of artemisinin (0.26-115.7 mg/tablet). Conclusion. This random survey confirms results from previous convenience surveys that counterfeit artesunate is a severe public health problem. The presence of artemisinin in counterfeits may encourage malaria resistance to artemisinin derivatives. With increasing accessibility of artemisinin-derivative combination therapy (ACT) in Laos, the removal of artesunate monotherapy from pharmacies may be an effective intervention. © 2009 Sengaloundeth et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Methods: A content analysis was performed on all relevant articles (N=547) published in two major daily newspapers, The Age and the Herald Sun, from 1993 to 2006. Articles were coded for article type, prominence, theme, spokesperson, topic slant and opinion slant. Results: The most frequent themes were the health effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure (24% of articles), education/prevention (14%) and product issues (12%). Themes that became more dominant over time were vitamin D issues, solaria issues and fake tans. Sixty per cent of articles included a prosun protection spokesperson and 12% an anti-sun protection spokesperson, with the profile of anti-sun protection spokespeople increasing over time. Half the articles reported on topics positive for sun protection, whereas 18% reported on negative topics; however, this difference narrowed considerably from 2001 onwards. In opinionated articles, the opinions expressed by authors were mainly positive (57%) rather than negative (7%) for sun protection. Conclusions and implications: The findings suggest that the mix of sun protection issues covered and views of sun protection have changed over time, resulting in greater coverage of controversies and issues not necessarily positive for sun protection objectives. These findings imply that evaluation of paid skin cancer prevention public education campaigns may need to take account of the changing news media environment in which they take place. © 2008 The Authors.

There is concern about an increasing infiltration of markets by substandard and fake medications against life-threatening diseases in developing countries. This is particularly worrying with regard to the increasing resistance development of Plasmodium falciparum against affordable anti-malarial medications, which has led to a change to more expensive drugs in most endemic countries. Methods. A representative sample of modern anti-malarial medications from licensed (public and private pharmacies, community health workers) and illicit (market and street vendors, shops) sources has been collected in the Nouna Health District in north-western Burkina Faso in 2006. All drugs were tested for their quality with the standard procedures of the German Pharma Health Fund-Minilab. Detected low standard drugs were re-tested with European Pharmacopoeia 2.9.1 standards for disintegration and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy at the laboratory of the Heidelberg University for confirmation. Results. Overall, 86 anti-malarial drug samples were collected, of which 77 samples have been included in the final analysis. The sample consisted of 39/77 (50%) chloroquine, 10/77 (13%) pyrimethamine- sulphadoxine, 9/77 (12%) quinine, 6/77 (8%) amodiaquine, 9/77 (12%) artesunate, and 4/77 (5%) artemether-lumefantrine. 32/77 (42%) drug samples were found to be of poor quality, of which 28 samples failed the visual inspection, nine samples had substandard concentrations of the active ingredient, four samples showed poor disintegration, and one sample contained non of the stated active ingredient. The licensed and the illicit market contributed 5/47 (10.6%) and 27/30 (90.0%) samples of substandard drugs respectively. Conclusion. These findings provide further evidence for the wide-spread existence of substandard anti-malarial medications in Africa and call for strengthening of the regulatory and quality control capacity of affected countries, particularly in view of the now wider available and substantially more costly artemisinin-based combination therapies. © 2008 Tipke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Although advertisers can target appropriate market segments, the model allows dishonest publishers to defraud the advertisers by simulating fake traffic to their own sites to claim more revenue. This paper addresses the case of publishers launching fraud attacks from numerous ma- chines, which is the most widespread scenario. The difficulty of uncovering these attacks is proportional to the number of machines and resources exploited by the fraudsters. In general, detecting this class of fraud entails solving a new data mining problem, which is finding correlations in multidimensional data. Since the dimen- sions have large cardinalities, the search space is huge, which has long allowed dishonest publishers to inflate their traffic, and deplete the advertisers' advertising budgets. We devise the approximate SLEUTH algorithms to solve the problem efficiently, and uncover single-publisher frauds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SLEUTH both analytically and by reporting some of its results on the Fastclick network, where numerous fraudsters were discovered. © 2008 VLDB Endowment."

Counterfeit drugs involve both lifesaving and lifestyle drugs. Objective: To review the health and economic consequences of counterfeit drugs on the US public and on the healthcare system as a whole. Method: This comprehensive review of the literature encompassed a search of MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, and ProQuest using the keywords ""counterfeit drugs,"" ""counterfeit medicines,"" ""fake drugs,"" and ""fake medicines."" A search of the various FiercePharma daily newsletter series on the healthcare market was also conducted. In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization websites were reviewed for additional information. Discussion: The issue of counterfeit drugs has been growing in importance in the United States, with the supply of these counterfeit drugs coming from all over the world. Innovation is important to economic growth and US competitiveness in the global marketplace, and intellectual property protections provide the ability for society to prosper from innovation. Especially important in terms of innovation in healthcare are the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. In addition to taking income from consumers and drug companies, counterfeit drugs also pose health hazards to patients, including death. The case of bevacizumab (Avastin) is presented as one recent example. Internet pharmacies, which are often the source of counterfeit drugs, often falsely portray themselves as Canadian, to enhance their consumer acceptance. Adding to the problems are drug shortages, which facilitate access for counterfeits. A long and convoluted supply chain also facilitates counterfeits. In addition, the wholesale market involving numerous firms is a convenient target for counterfeit drugs. Trafficking in counterfeits can be extremely profitable; detection of counterfeits is difficult, and the penalties are modest. Conclusion: Counterfeit drugs pose a public health hazard, waste consumer income, and reduce the incentive to engage in research and development and innovation. Stronger state licensure supervision of drug suppliers would be helpful. Technological approaches, such as the Radio Frequency Identification devices, should also be considered. Finally, counterfeit drugs may raise concerns among consumers about safety and reduce patient medication adherence."

The major challenge now is to get the drugs to the right people. Current evidence suggests that most of those who need the drugs do not get them. Simultaneously, a high proportion of those who are given antimalarials do not in fact have malaria. Financial and other barriers mean that, in many settings, the majority of those with malaria, particularly the poorest, do not access formal healthcare, so the provision of free antimalarials via this route has only limited impact.

As a result, the quantity of antiquities being offered for sale to individual travellers diminished steadily. The continuing high demand for Egyptian artefacts under the influence of ever-expanding international tourism and the increasing impact of twentieth-century antiquities legislation gave rise to a new industry at al-Qurna: the production of fakes to be sold as genuine antiques and the production of Egyptian artefacts for sale to international visitors. This article explores the close connections between the archaeological landscape of the Theban Necropolis, international tourism, and the artisanal production and marketing of artefacts of ancient Egyptian design by local craftsmen."

In Africa, the lack of access to innovative drugs makes the population vulnerable to counterfeits and inefficacious copies of medicines that are much needed. This humanitarian crisis rests on policymakers' steadfastness in each country to ensure the authenticity of the drug supply. Among the steps that should be taken is the restriction of the sale of drugs to pharmacies and hospitals and the prohibition of their sale through street vendors and open markets. There is also an urgent need for post-importation testing to ensure drugs actually contain their active ingredients in adequate strength before they are sold. These are necessary parts of a needed comprehensive approach to combating the importation of counterfeit, weakened, and adulterated drugs. Countries have it within their power to protect their populations, ensure the integrity of medications, and restore trust in their healthcare systems."

Sales in counterfeit medicines are threatening to grow to be worth $75 billion by 2010, which would mean an increase of 92% over 2005. The problem mainly occurs in developing countries. In Nigeria for example 50% of all sold medicines is not in accordance with pharmaceutical requirements, but also within the European Union the amount of seizures of counterfeit medicines grows strongly. In order to verify the authenticity of medicines, different kinds of technologies have already been developed. However, none of the suggested systems or methods are completely counterfeit-resistant, and on top of that it seems highly unlikely that one technology could be used in the entire world. An important medium, used by people to sell counterfeit medicines, is the Internet. No less than 50% of all medicines offered on the Internet are fake. It is very difficult to control the Internet trade because national inspection organisations are restricted by the boundaries of their country. Often, these fraudulent websites conceal international criminal networks. These networks benefit of the anonymity, flexibility and of the large trading area that the Internet offers them. Furthermore, a lot of money can be made in the counterfeit medicine business, while the chance of ever being condemned or convicted is very little. Several national and international organisations are very concerned about the problems regarding counterfeit medicines. A highly advanced cooperation could definitely improve the efficiency of their work, due to the complementary character of their actions. Nevertheless, until today no coordinated international network exists, equipped with the required legal instruments to tackle the trade in counterfeit medicines."

As a well-known platform of SM in tourism, TA serves as an independent review site where visitors share their holiday experiences. Design/methodology/approach – The sample for this study includes hotel businesses located in Istanbul, Turkey, and listed in the top grades of TA ratings. Purposive sampling was used to obtain relevant data. A holistic multiple-case study was designed, as sample hotels vary in offcial class and attributes. Structured interviews were used to collect data from participating managers in each hotel business. Upon creation of the data set, transcripts were used to develop and classify a matrix table (hotels vs questions) and analysed by clustering responses according to the content of questions. Findings – The study fndings show that hotels pay signifcant attention to TA and that it is viewed as an essential tool for various purposes. Hotel businesses beneft from the content of TA for the purpose of marketing and quality management. From a strategic point of view, hotel businesses consider TA as an “ocean of opportunity” that is highly related to service quality, reliable information channels and effective tools to monitor competitors and for undertaking self-review of performance. Research limitations/implications – The sample group represents only hotel businesses in the city, and the study utilizes only qualitative techniques. A similar empirical investigation in a resort destination and a longitudinal comparable study using both qualitative and quantitative techniques may generate more insights relating to the social media practices of hotel businesses. Practical implications – Hotel businesses consider accuracy, transparency and consistency of content and pricing to be essential prerequisites of competitiveness. As a consequence, this study reveals the fact that TA is a critical tool of SM utilized by hotels with different attributes, despite some concerns regarding fake reviews. Originality/value – This is an insightful comparative study of TA practices of hotel businesses with different attributes. The study may inspire further research to study SM practices and related impacts on a longitudinal basis. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited"

In contemporary Johannesburg and Soweto the originators of money multiplication schemes and the agents who work to recruit new members position themselves in this context as financial entrepreneurs and brokers who embody a range of seemingly contradictory discourses, drawing on discourses of empowerment, self-help, entrepreneurship and religiously sanctioned wealth and prosperity in the course of their risk taking in the field of finance. Based on a series of case studies of female agents of push-push schemes, the article shows how many of these discourses reflect some of the conditions of contemporary capitalism: citizens are expected to be active investors, active entrepreneurs and hard workers who are able to work from home and without a boss. Moreover, the schemes use sophisticated technologies, marketing strategies and other practices which simulate formality, legality and sincerity echoing religious practices and discourses. At the same time a set of cultural values and social logics that are not necessarily produced by neo-liberal capitalism and financialization, but are certainly activated by them, makes it hard for citizens to recognize or admit the forms of deception involved, unless deception is seen to be central to the operation of the modern state or the present get-rich-quick culture. Risk taking, and pursuit of social mobility, originate in dual economy legacies, with their unfulfilled expectations, wealth disparities and frustrated class aspiration. Participants in pyramid schemes have ideologies combining progress with imminent doom, entrepreneurship with greed: contradictory attitudes reflective of financialization in the broader world. © International African Institute 2012."

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with nitrogen-phosphorus specific detection, gel electrophoresis, and immunological tests were employed to test for the effective content of 70 products. In 18 cases (25.7%), the declared ingredients differed from the actual content, in particular concerning anabolic-androgenic steroids. Nandrolone and trenbolone esters, for instance, were frequently substituted or complemented by various testosterone derivatives, and several testosterone depot formulations originally composed of four different esters were found to contain fewer or wrong components.

Surprisingly, factors driving the demand for fake products have attracted far less attention than supply-side remedies. This paper attempts to redress this imbalance by investigating the demand for counterfeits. Specifically, we consolidate existing findings and develop a comprehensive yet parsimonious model of the antecedents and drivers of voluntary counterfeit purchases. Following the frequent call for more cross-national comparisons, we used a sample of over 900 consumers from Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Austria, and Mexico to test our model. This large-scale approach calls existing findings into question and raises provocative thoughts guiding future research in the area."

Increasingly, however, trust is not just a national matter, but involves cross-border flows of knowledge, threats and promises.Methods: Data for this paper comes from the project 'Tracing Pharmaceuticals in South Asia', which used ethnographic fieldwork and qualitative interviews to compared the trajectories of three pharmaceuticals (Rifampicin, Oxytocin and Fluoxetine) from producer to patient in three sites (north India, West Bengal and Nepal) between 2005-08.Results: We argue that issues of trust are crucial in reducing the likelihood of appropriate use of medicines. Unlike earlier discussions of trust, we suggest that trust contexts beyond the patient-practitioner relationship are important. We illustrate these arguments through three case studies: (i) a conflict over ethics in Nepal, involving a suggested revised ethical code for retailers, medical representatives, producers and prescribers; (ii) disputes over counterfeit, fake, substandard and spurious medicines, and quality standards in Indian generic companies, looking particularly at the role played by the US FDA; and (iii) the implications of lack of trust in the DOTS programmes in India and Nepal for the relationships among patients, government and the private sector.Conclusions: We conclude that the building of trust is a necessary but always vulnerable and contingent process. While it might be desirable to outline steps that can be taken to build trust, the range of conflicting interests in the pharmaceutical field make feasible solutions hard to implement. © 2011 Brhlikova et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

This paper shows how the pharmaceutical industry plays a major role in the lack of access to essential medicines for sexual and reproductive health care, by a) investing in products for profit-making reasons despite their negative health impact (e.g. hormone replacement therapy), b) marketing new essential medicines at prices beyond the reach of countries that most need them (e.g. HPV vaccines), and c) failing to invest in the development of new products (e.g. microbicides and medical abortion pills). Small companies, some of them non-profit-making, struggle to fill some of that demand (e.g. for female condoms). International patent protection contributes to high prices of medicines, and while international agreements such as compulsory licensing under TRIPS and the Medicines Patent Pool allow for mechanisms to enable poorer countries to get access to essential medicines, the obstacles created by ""big pharma"" are daunting. All these barriers have fostered a market in sub-standard medicines (e.g. fake medical abortion pills sold over the internet). An agenda driven by sexual and reproductive health needs, based on the right to health, must focus on universal access to essential medicines at prices developing countries can afford. We call for greater public investment in essential medicines, expanded production of affordable generic drugs, and the development of broad strategic plans, that include affordable medicines and technologies, for addressing identified public health problems, such as cervical cancer. © 2011 Reproductive Health Matters."

The understanding and identification of fraudulent activity (i.e., fake views) in video ads for advertisers, is complicated as they rely exclusively on the detection mechanisms deployed by video hosting portals. In this context, the development of independent tools able to monitor and audit the fidelity of these systems are missing today and needed by both industry and regulators. In this paper we present a first set of tools to serve this purpose. Using our tools, we evaluate the performance of the audit systems of five major online video portals. Our results reveal that YouTube's detection system significantly outperforms all the others. Despite this, a systematic evaluation indicates that it may still be susceptible to simple attacks. Furthermore, we find that YouTube penalizes its videos' public and monetized view counters differently, the former being more aggressive. This means that views identified as fake and discounted from the public view counter are still monetized. We speculate that even though YouTube's policy puts in lots of effort to compensate users after an attack is discovered, this practice places the burden of the risk on the advertisers, who pay to get their ads displayed."

Manual approaches to detecting and analyzing fake reviews (i.e., spam) are not practical due to the problem of information overload. However, the design and development of automated methods of detecting fake reviews is a challenging research problem. The main reason is that fake reviews are specifically composed to mislead readers, so they may appear the same as legitimate reviews (i.e., ham). As a result, discriminatory features that would enable individual reviews to be classified as spam or ham may not be available. Guided by the design science research methodology, the main contribution of this study is the design and instantiation of novel computational models for detecting fake reviews. In particular, a novel text mining model is developed and integrated into a semantic language model for the detection of untruthful reviews. The models are then evaluated based on a real-world dataset collected from amazon.com. The results of our experiments confirm that the proposed models outperform other well-known baseline models in detecting fake reviews. To the best of our knowledge, the work discussed in this article represents the first successful attempt to apply text mining methods and semantic language models to the detection of fake consumer reviews.

Advertising fake routes in response to route request (RREQ) packets, and advertising according to route reply (RREP) packets. In related works, Black hole attack has been evaluated and analyzed based on creating fake RREPs in response to received RREQ packets.

The roles of the venture capitalists are played by retired professionals in the community that have run businesses with revenues exceeding $50 M/year, have started new technology based ventures or have managed researchers in a commercial environment. We instruct the venture capitalists to play the role as tough managers who require data and not fluff before they part with their precious venture capital financing. VC and Technology business managers must negotiate on the purchase price for shares of their company with lesser performing companies giving up a greater share of their company in the negotiation. Students utilize techniques presented in the first two classes in their curriculum (Investigations in Technology and Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation) to develop their marketing and technology strategies. The students appreciate the fact that they are able to take risks and make mistakes in a simulation environment where financial disasters are made with fake money. After utilizing this simulation program for three years, we have found that nontraditional students who have been working in an engineering field typically perform better than the traditional graduate students who are entering their graduate program immediately after receiving their bachelor's degree. Our experience is that all engineering technology students (regardless of when they enter the program) are weak in their comfort and understanding of financial data and that this is a weakness that we need to correct in both the undergraduate and graduate programs. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009."

One type of actionable format is designed to drive consumers to the advertised brand&#8217;s Web site. For example, in a commercial for Bayerische Motoren Werke AG&#8217;s Mini Cooper, consumers are warned of crisis and urged not to be taken in by buying a fake Mini Cooper. This joking, non-traditional commercial is popular with the type of consumers who prefer Minis. The ad directs concerned consumers to a Web site where they can learn more about spotting fake Minis and even submit photos of fake Minis they create. In managerial practice and in academics, understanding consumer factors in the context of responses to Web sites announcements in advertisements is an under researched area (Koufaris et al. 2002). Thus, the purpose of the study is contribute to our understanding of direct and interactive marketing by examining the role played by emotional reactions and shopping enjoyment in visiting Web sites announced in advertisements. It is specifically proposed that shopping enjoyment mediates the relationship between emotional responses and intentions to visit Web sites announced in advertisements. Three key aspects of emotional responses to the environment have been identified that include pleasure, arousal, and dominance (Mehrabian and Russell 1974). Arguably, these three components should be related to playful and enjoyable activities such as shopping enjoyment (Holbrook et al. 1984). As long as consumers perceive value in the enjoyment of shopping and continued search and do not see these activities as simply a loss of time, the less subjective value they will assign to shopping time (Marmorstein et al. 1992). Following a similar line of reasoning, shopping enjoyment should be positively related to intentions to visit Web sites announced in advertisements.

This debate has caused unfounded speculation about the extent of the potential market for tiger products. To fill this knowledge gap, we surveyed 1880 residents from a total of six Chinese cities to understand Urban Chinese tiger consumption behavior, knowledge of trade issues and attitudes towards tiger conservation. We found that 43% of respondents had consumed some products alleged to contain tiger parts. Within this user-group, 71% said that they preferred wild products over farmed ones. The two predominant products used were tiger bone plasters (38%) and tiger bone wine (6.4%) 88% of respondents knew that it was illegal to buy or sell tiger products, and 93% agreed that a ban in trade of tiger parts was necessary to conserve wild tigers. These results indicate that while Urban Chinese people are generally supportive of tiger conservation, there is a huge residual demand for tiger products that could resurge if the ban on trade in tiger parts is lifted in China. We suspect that the current supply of the market is predominantly met by fakes or substitutes branded as tiger medicines, but not listing tiger as an ingredient. We suggest that the Traditional Chinese Medicine community should consider re-branding these products as bone-healing medicines in order to reduce the residual demand for real tiger parts over the long-term. The lifting of the current ban on trade in farmed tiger parts may cause a surge in demand for wild tiger parts that consumers say are better. Because of the low input costs associated with poaching, wild-sourced parts would consistently undercut the prices of farmed tigers that could easily be laundered on a legal market. We therefore recommend that the Chinese authorities maintain the ban on trade in tiger parts, and work to improve the enforcement of the existing ban."

New printing technologies are making it easier and easier to emulate the packaging of brands, often with readily available office equipment. This counterfeiting can have severe effects on both the brand owners and the purchasers of the goods. This effect can result in the loss of profit or the end user being misled into buying something that it is not-in effect theft. For the brand owner the consequence is greater-they lose both the value of the sale and they put their own brand at risk when the products sold turn out to be of poor quality-leading to reduced perception of the brand and potentially lost future sales. There is now increasing evidence that counterfeiters are moving into product lines where the effect is not only economic, it can put lives at risk Food, car parts, aircraft parts, medicines, electronics and electrical good are all suffering. Whilst in first stage counterfeiting the result was only economic, in these categories of goods fake goods put lives directly at risk. Faulty brake pads, drugs with no active ingredient, or sometimes poisons present, unsafe or out of date food, repackaged as wholesome, high quality products. These are life-threatening consequences of the desire to make easy money by copying real products. Fortunately, the development of new printing and coding technologies also enables new authentication and traceability techniques that are available to manufacturers to trace, authenticate and then defeat the march of counterfeit goods. In this paper, we will look at techniques that can be cheaply applied to products to ensure that fake goods can be identified, supply chains managed and counterfeiters controlled. Topics to be addressed are:- □ Digital printing of products with identifiable features to tie products to batches or markets. □ The use of active or reactive inks to provide additional features to allow end users to verify the products they buy. □ The use of latest generation bar coding to act as a complementary data carrier- allowing verification of products without the need to use expensive or complex IT systems. □ The techniques covered use a number of different, low cost and already available printing and coding techniques to show what can be achieved with today's technology. We look at coding techniques, authentication and layering options available to manufacturers and show how they can be used as part of an assault against the manufacturers and distributors of fake goods."

Genuinely developed for therapeutic use, their abuse/misuse generates enormous health risks, which has necessitated comprehensive controls of compound trafficking by customs and anti-doping authorities. Methods: From 2012 to 2013, the Bureau of Customs Investigation confiscated products containing anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS; 259 kg), stimulants (13 kg), selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs; 24 kg), and human growth hormone (hGH; 3500 ampules). In cooperation with the Bureau and under the umbrella of the European Monitoring Center for Emerging Doping Agents (EuMoCEDA), the Cologne Anti-Doping Laboratory analyzed an additional 337 (black market) products between 2010 and 2013, allowing to monitor developments in drug use and, hence, the anticipation of new challenges in sports drug testing. Main tools utilized in characterizing confiscated materials were liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS), and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with subsequent bottom-up identification of peptidic compounds using nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS). Results: Among the 337 substances analyzed in the doping control laboratory in Cologne, 67 active ingredients were found, 49 of which being categorized as doping agents by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). A total of 83.7 % accounted for steroidal substances (predominantly testosterone, trenbolone, and nandrolone and corresponding esters), 12.8 % accounted for peptide hormones and growth factors (predominantly hGH and growth hormone releasing peptides (GHRPs)), 3.2 % of the products contained hormones and metabolic modulators, and 0.3 % accounted for diuretic agents. Outstanding findings were the detection of the selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) LGD-4033, the thymic hormone thymosin β4, and a fusion protein of unknown biological activity. Conclusions: Trafficking of considerable amounts of arguably performance and/or body-enhancing compounds has been observed during the past 4 years, the majority of which is categorized as relevant to sports drug testing.

User profiles, such as click streams logging every site the user accesses, are exploited to generate a profile of interests of the users. Marketing measures like advertisements in form of banners or product presentation are tailored according to these profiles. This kind of customizing suffers from insufficient information about the current interests of the users: the profiles are only a collection of past actions of the users. Additionally, sometimes personalization is seen an invasion of privacy and often unsolicited advertisements unrelated to the users' real interests are cited as an example of the nuisances of 1-to-1 marketing. This shows the dilemma that 1-to-1 marketing faces: The users feel they already offer too much information about themselves. Currently, users solve this dilemma by disabling all technical means that enable user profiling, e.g. by disabling cookies in their Web browsers, using anonymity services, and providing fake identities to Web sites. We propose an approach based on peer-to-peer networks to allow marketing to a specific target group while preserving the privacy of users, we call it mask-marketing. In this concept a user assumes the identity of a mask representing his or her intentions. E.g., a user buying a Christmas present will use the ""Christmas shopping"" identity, afterwards the same user may use an ""engineering"" mask for an information search relating to his work. The users are able to present their preferences and intentions without these being attributable to their true identity. The masks, which are technically realized by sharing cookies, are distributed and updated using a peer-to-peer networking approach. This permits use of a mask by several different users. All actions performed by different users under the identity of one mask contribute to the profile of this mask. Creation and distribution don't require a central service. This is an advantage since the sensitive profile data is not concentrated in a central entity in the network, which could be viewed by privacy sensitive users with suspicion. © 2003 IEEE."

The economy has grown rapidly at an average of 9.8% per year from 1978 to 1994. Medical expenditure, especially for drugs, has grown even more rapidly. The increase in medical expenditure can be attributed to changing disease patterns, a higher proportion of older people in the population and fee-for-service incentives for hospitals. Due to the changing economic system and higher cost of health care, the Chinese government has reformed its health care system, including its health and drug policy. The drug policy reform has led to more comprehensive policy elements, including registration, production, distribution, utilization and administration As a part of drug policy reform, the drug distribution network has also been changed, from a centrally controlled supply system (push system) to a market-oriented demand system (pull system). Hospitals can now purchase drugs directly from drug companies, factories and retailers, leading to increased price competition. Patients have easier access to drugs as more drugs are available on the market. At the same time, this has also entailed negative effects. The old drug administrative system is not suitable for the new drug distribution network. It is easy for people to get drugs on the market and this can lead to overuse and misuse. Marketing factors have influenced drug distribution so strongly that there is a risk of fake or low quality drugs being distributed. The government has taken some measures to fight these negative effects. This paper describes the drug policy reform in China, particularly the distribution of drugs to health care facilities."

Here, we have used the word ""faux"" to mean ""fake"" or ""false"" - customers who look new in the next month (because we did not observe them in the first month), but are indeed customers (because they made a purchase before the first month, a month for which we do not have data). That is, there are ""faux-new"" customers and ""actual-new"" customers whom we will observe in the second month. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses data and statistics from numerous loyalty-marketing programs to support its conclusions. It investigates a technique discussed by R.A. Fisher in counting species and applies the technique toward counting customers. It showcases the Poisson distribution assumption in modeling customer frequency of purchases. Findings - The study found the technique to be robust against a large real-world data set: the technique was predictive despite some dubious assumptions. Practical implications - When statisticians and marketers attempt to estimate new customer growth rates, they must be careful. It is tempting to estimate the monthly growth in your customer base by observing the number of customers in July, and then observe the number of ""new"" customers in August. In this case, however, the results would be overestimated. Many customers who transacted in August but not in July are not actually ""new"" customers - they are ""faux-new"" customers. They could very well have transacted in April (assuming that one does not have the luxury of observing months before July). To estimate the actual number of new customers, it is necessary first to need to strip out the number of customers that were estimated ""zero-purchase,"" or ""faux-new,"" customers in July.

For many consumers, the intangibility of information system-based processes generates beliefs that they are fake, non-genuine, artificial and therefore inherently risky to use. This perceived artificiality phenomenon was shown to increase risk concerns, which in-turn inhibited system adoption. Investigating reactions to an e-service replacement of a paper process enabled testing of this proposed conceptual causal chain. Results suggest that the inherent intangibility of e-services creates concerns measured in raised perceived artificiality and perceived risk. Interestingly, mental rather than physical intangibility increased artificiality concerns. Perceived artificiality directly increased risk concerns and indirectly affected system evaluation and adoption, which were primarily affected by system perceived risk. This exploratory research suggests a research model that provides a first step towards understanding the effect of information systems' inherent intangibility on system evaluation and adoption, and may be utilized when testing risk-reducing system enhancements."

E-commerce is divided into two major components: Business to Consumer (B to C), and Business to Business (B to B). The main applications in B to C are dissemination of medical and drug information, and the sale of drugs through the Internet. Medical information on the Internet is vast and very helpful for patients, however, its reliability is not guaranteed. Online pharmacies increase the accessibility and availability of drugs. Nevertheless, several obstacles such as security of the data provided (both financial and clinical) prevent the widespread use of online pharmacies. Another risk is the health authorities' inability to regulate Internet sites effectively. Therefore, unregulated sale of prescription drugs, fake or substandard, often occurs on the Internet. B to B relates to physicians, clinics, hospitals, HMO's and pharmaceutical companies. There is a vast number of applications ranging from clinical research, marketing and sales promotion, to drug distribution and logistics. In conclusion, the Internet is dynamic and has contributed to the development of numerous new applications in the field of pharmaceuticals.

In some cases, salt s or organic acids are previously added. At 80-85 OC, the first particles of curd form; at 85-95 'C, the curd may be cooked for a few minutes to reduce moisture content and/or to obtain the desirable level of browning. After drainage at room temperature during molding for ca. 4 h, whey cheese is stored at ca. 4 'C. The typical mass yield is 6%, but addition of milk, calcium salts and preliminary concentration of protein (by condensation or ultrafiltration techniques) may increase yield considerably. Some types of whey cheeses are supposed to be consumed within a short time upon manufacture (e.g., Ricotta, Requeijdo and Manouri), whereas others bear a longer shelf life (e.g., Gjetost, Mysost and Myzithra). Whey cheeses are significantly different from one another in terms of chemical composition, which is mainly due to variations in the source and type of whey, as well as to the processing practices followed. Moisture content and pH of whey cheeses are usually high and favor microorganism growth (molds, yeasts, lactic acid bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae account for the dominant microflora in these cheeses). Adequate packaging of whey cheeses should be provided, and legislation should be prepared to fix standard characteristics of each type of whey cheese, and hence protect typical products from adulteration and fakes. Marketing efforts should also be aimed at increasing whey cheese consumption, either directly or incorporated in desserts, snack dips and pasta-type dishes. © 2001, Sage Publications.

As branded products increase in value, counterfeited imitations are finding their way to market. To protect a company's reputation and bottom line, security holograms have been used to authenticate products. Using a variety of different holographic techniques, holograms can be designed to meet the needs of a specific application, from financial documents to designer jeans. Holograms are unable to be photocopied or scanned. They can be made to be tamper evident. Overall, they are very difficult to replicate without substantial investment. By providing a visual cue to both merchants and customers, holograms can help keep fake goods off store shelves. And the holographic effects provide a unique marketing tool by attracting consumer attention on busy store shelves."

Methods: 1,509 New South Wales residents aged 15 years and over, selected at random, completed a computer-assisted telephone survey. Results: Thirty-three per cent of respondents thought fake tanning lotions were unsafe. In relation to The Cancer Council marketing fake tanning lotions, more than three-fifths thought The Cancer Council would be promoting tans, although 62% thought it would be a good thing as fake tans are safer than tanning in the sun. Nine per cent of respondents had used fake tanning lotions'in the past 12 months. Almost half (48%) of female current users used fake tanning lotions occasionally or only for special occasions during the past summer. In particular settings, the sunscreen an3 hat-wearing practices of female users and non-users of fake tanning lotions differed significantly. Conclusion: There appears to be no consistent data to suggest that fake tanning lotions may be used as a safer alternative to sun tanning. However, there is a responsibility to at least disseminate accurate information on these products."

Such clinics intentionally deceive pregnant women into believing that they provide a full range of women’s: Health services when, in reality, they provide only a pregnancy test, accompanied by intense anti-abortion propaganda. Because fake abortion clinics threaten women’s interests in “privacy” and decisional autonomy, state attorneys general should challenge them under deceptive business practice statutes.

The first type of cheating we consider occurs when the seller spies on the bids of a second-price auction and then inserts a fake bid in order to increase the payment of the winning bidder. In the second type, a bidder cheats in a first-price auction by examining the competing bids before deciding on his own bid. In both cases, we derive equilibrium strategies when bidders are aware of the possibility of cheating. These results provide insights into sealed-bid auctions even in the absence of cheating, including some counterintuitive results on the effects of overbidding in a first-price auction."

The program was much devoted to the issues of brand protection and intellectual property rights (IPR), examining the scale of the problem and addressing the issues of theft of intellectual property, fakes, and unauthorized usage. Another speaker reviewed how the industry was fighting against widespread piracy through education, investigations, and advertising. Steps are also being taken to stop terrorist funding through counterfeiting and piracy."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Pharmacies and shops selling antimalarial drugs in Myanmar (Burma), Lao PDR, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of artemisinin derivatives or mefloquine containing drugs of substandard quality. RESULTS: Of the 188 tablet packs purchased which were labelled as 'artesunate' 53% did not contain any artesunate. All counterfeit artesunate tablets were labelled as manufactured by 'Guilin Pharma', and refinements of the fake blisterpacks made them often hard to distinguish from their genuine counterparts. No other artemisinin derivatives were found to be counterfeited. Of the 44 mefloquine samples, 9% contained <10% of the expected amount of active ingredient. CONCLUSIONS: An alarmingly high proportion of antimalarial drugs bought in pharmacies and shops in mainland SE Asia are counterfeit, and the problem has increased significantly compared with our previous survey in 1999-2000. This is a serious threat to public health in the region."

This inductive study of 18 British manufacturers and their Chinese intermediaries led to propositions exploring the mechanism behind the marked differences. Findings from the study indicate that low channel intensity may restrict exporting manufacturers' market coverage and expose them to high risks of intermediary opportunism in emerging markets where channel environments are highly uncertain and legal frameworks are weak. However, low channel intensity policy can be an appropriate option when exporting manufacturers face the threats of gray marketing and fake products or when they require heavy intermediary commitments. © 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers."
